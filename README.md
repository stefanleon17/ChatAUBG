# ChatAUBG

This project consists of a basic corpus-based chatbot, trained using a dataset obtained by scraping text data off of the AUBG website (aubg.edu). It uses a Markov-Chain-Based algorithm to generate text, and makes use of a combined unigram-bigram classification algorithm to classify user input into one of the webpages considered, subsequently using the text present on that webpage to bias the generation algorithm, leading, in theory, to more specific and accurate replies. Final results are mixed, with some of the functionalities performing as hypothesized, and others performing more unpredictably. Implications and potential future improvements are further discussed.
