"The Board of Trustees is the governing body of the American University in Bulgaria and exercises fiduciary responsibility for the institution’s welfare. The board sets AUBG’s strategic direction and
oversees the president, who is in turn responsible for carrying out the board’s plans and the overall management of the institution. The board’s role is strategic and supervisory, not operational. The board sets the university’s direction and broadly oversees policy, but delegates implementation of policy and institutional management to the president, the university administration, and the faculty.
Board members support the public image of the university both through the board’s corporate actions and through individual advocacy. Regardless of individual financial capacity, board members
are the philanthropic leaders of the university, setting an example through their support for other donors and friends. Under the leadership of the board chair, the trustees appoint and offer advice and counsel to the President, and consult with the President on the appointment of senior officers of the university. Board members respect the faculty’s and students’ academic freedom, and will support and protect that freedom when it is threatened by external forces. (It should be noted that “Academic Freedom” does not encompass libel, slander, hate speech, or willful dissemination of falsehoods.)
As the final authority for college or university business, trustees make all legal and fiduciary decisions for the university, although they delegate some specific powers and duties to others. The
board of trustees is responsible for developing and approving the school’s mission, strategic goals and objectives, and establishing policies related to programs, services and capital expenditures, including construction. In a structure of shared governance with the faculty, the board approves certain academic actions such as creation and/or closure of programs, faculty promotions, and
specific kinds of academic policies, though the primary authority for such policies rests with the faculty. The board approves the annual budget and sets major fees including tuition, room and
board, and supervises the university endowment."

"Dr. Ensign earned her BA from New College in Florida and her Ph.D. in International Political Economy from the University of Maryland, with a dissertation in Artificial Intelligence and Economics.  She is so proud of her daughter, Katherine Aronson-Ensign, who completed her PhD in 2022, and is now the Associate Director of Research and Evaluation at Jumpstart for Young Children."
"Dr. Ensign has been interviewed multiple times by the BBC and CNN, and her writings have been published in The Washington Post, The Philadelphia Inquirer, The Hill, The Chronicle of Higher Education, Inside Higher Ed, The Army Times, The Huffington Post, and Hechinger Report, among others."
"Dr. Ensign is a long-time advocate for connecting learning to community engagement.

"As a liberal arts institution, AUBG encourages you to develop and utilize your knowledge across areas of study, and the Self-Designed Major (SDM) is crafted to allow this by fostering a broader understanding of academic knowledge and methodologies.



This degree offers you an opportunity for a one-of-a-kind intensive educational and research experience through a self-designed program. Combined with a second major, the Self-Designed major at AUBG will allow you to pursue your biggest passions and devise your own program with the personal guidance of top professors across multiple disciplines.



SDM is offered for students with exceptional motivation, vision, and creativity. In consultation with faculty members, you will create a unique plan of study that is not part of the current AUBG curriculum and that bridges two or more content areas (other than two major program areas) and is not a subcomponent of one major or minor discipline. The result is an interdisciplinary degree that focuses on integrated learning in multiple areas with sufficient depth to conduct research across fields of knowledge.



Students completing an SDM will receive diplomas with their specific, interdisciplinary field listed as the title of the degree (e.g., “B.A. in Political Communication” or “B.A. in Women’s Studies”)."

This is the level where the technical familiarity with structures is expanded into various practical applications – tenses to tell a story, Present Continuous to express future plans, the modal verb can to express permission. The students should learn to use the tenses they know in wider contexts. In addition, at the Intermediate level students are capable of handling a larger vocabulary load.

"Social Entrepreneurship, at its core, means attempting to mobilize the resources of the community, business, and government to address socially important topics and problems. It is an effort to generate new ways of functioning as a society and as individuals, new business models, but also ways of improving the current models in order to reflect the society’s demands. As a discipline, it combines studying entrepreneurship, innovation, ethics, corporate social responsibility, and a long list of other subjects.

It helps us become better executives and better citizen at the same time. It helps us refine our business vision and improve our business practices. More importantly, it helps us redefine our company’s and our own individual place and contribution in society."

You can apply for need-based financial aid!
https://www.aubg.edu/admissions/bachelors/cost-aid/application-for-financial-aid/

Application for Financial Aid
AUBG provides financial aid and awards scholarships based either on academic merit or based on both academic merit and financial need. Merit is the academic potential that we can see in your application documents. Financial need is determined through an analysis of the Application for Financial Aid (AFA) and supporting documents submitted as part of the application package or your successfully submitted Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).
Can I send the documents by email?
"Carefully read the AFA instructions. The AFA application form starts with guidance, and there are detailed explanations you can download below."
Check the Deadlines
Collect the supporting documents listed in the checklist. An Application for Financial Aid with insufficient supporting documents will not be considered. Beware that it may take more than a month to collect all the documents from various institutions.
Contact your Admissions Counselor! They will be able to answer your questions about the Application for Financial Aid and the required supporting documents.
Documents supporting the AFA must be scanned originals. All documents should be for the most recent 12-month period and translated into English (by a sworn translator) unless they are in Bulgarian or English.
"Download and Fill in the application form and sign it. By signing the application you are asking to be considered on the basis of the documents enclosed. You can not include additional documents later. Make sure the AFA is complete; the fields with no data mark with ""N/A"". If you are unable to complete any section of the application or send any of the required documents, please include an explanation on line 58 of AFA."
Express your intention
"Get up to 20% off your tuition, if you decide to apply for financial aid.
Note that if you indicate you don't need financial aid while filling up the application form, once submitted, you can't change your mind later."
How much financial aid can I receive?
"If you intend to apply for need-based financial support, make sure to prioritize your application by meeting each admissions deadline. As soon as you complete your application, quickly move on to your financial aid application, gathering the necessary supporting documents. Don't wait for the decision—begin this important step right away."
"If you need help, email or call your counselor a minimum of three days before the application deadline."
Is my information kept confidential?
"It depends. We can't answer this question until we receive the full package of documents. In some cases, need-based financial assistance covers 20% of tuition."
Make sure to indicate that you'd like to apply for Financial Aid when filling up the AUBG Application form.
No. You must upload scanned copy of the Application for Financial Aid and the supporting documents to your online application's Status Page.
"Note that if you state that you are not applying for need-based aid, you will not be considered for this potential 20% reduction. Once you submit the AUBG Application Form, you will not have the chance to apply, in case you change your mind."
"Send your FAFSA to AUBG using our Federal School Code, G34423."
Step 1: Instructions
Step 2: Supporting Documents
Step 3: Complete the application
Step 4: Review
Step 5: Submit
Submit your completed AUBG Application Form and all the supporting documents by uploading scanned copies to AUBG's Application Portal from the Status Page before the application deadline.
The financial information provided by applicants is confidential. The American University in Bulgaria obeys the Law for Protection of Personal Data. The information collected is kept strictly confidential and is used only by the Financial Aid Committee to determine a grant amount for the prospective AUBG student.
The submission of AFA or FAFSA is optional - you are not required to file it unless you want to apply for need-based financial aid and need-based scholarships. No need-based award will be awarded without a complete AFA and a complete set of supporting documents or FAFSA.
"Timing matters. Applying earlier could make all the difference in the support you receive. We have a limited pool of resources available to assist students, and the sooner you submit your application, the better your prospects for securing financial assistance."
U.S. citizens or eligible Non-U.S. citizens may submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) instead of AUBG's Application for Financial Aid. To see if you are an eligible non-U.S. citizen visit studentaid.gov.

Changes to the 2024-25 FAFSA
"Complete a Master Promissory Note.

Request a Direct PLUS loan.

Get confirmation of credit check Continuing students should follow the same processes above but are not required to complete the Entrance Counselling component.
Please make sure that you have completed everything you have to do before we start to do our part because if the school starts origination and anything is not completed by you, then all our stages for each loan will fail, which will cost you time waiting to be told before you have to start over again. Our university will not know if you have completed all the processes for all the loans you intend to borrow unless you tell us – which you do by sending us the correct documents as pdf files, and we do not know how much you wish to borrow until you tell us – by reading and signing the award letter that you will be sent."
"Complete Entrance Counselling - The U.S. Department of Education requires first-time borrowers of the federal Direct loan to complete a loan entrance counseling session before the loan funds can be disbursed. You can complete this online on the studentloans.gov web site. This counseling session provides you with information that will help you understand your rights and responsibilities as a loan borrower, as well as other tools to assist you with managing your loans."
"Decrease or cancel your loan
If you wish to decrease your loan, please contact the Student Loan Team and send an explanation of the changes you would like to be applied. The reduction will be spread across your remaining disbursements. Please note that you cannot decrease your loan below the amounts already disbursed in the current academic year. You must email us at least two weeks before the next disbursement date to ensure the decrease can be applied to that disbursement."
"Direct Subsidized Loan
Direct subsidized loans are for undergraduate students with demonstrated financial need. AUBG will review the results of your Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and determine the amount you can borrow. You are not charged interest while you're in school at least half-time and during grace periods and deferment periods.
Direct Unsubsidized Loan
You are not required to demonstrate financial need to receive a Direct Unsubsidized Loan. Like subsidized loans, AUBG will determine the amount you are eligible to borrow. Interest accrues (accumulates) on an unsubsidized loan from the time it is first disbursed even during the time a student is in school and during grace and deferment periods. You can pay the interest while you are in school and during grace periods and deferment or forbearance periods, or you can allow it to accrue and be capitalized (that is, added to the principal amount of your loan). If you choose not to pay the interest as it accrues, this will increase the total amount you have to repay because you will be charged interest on a higher principal amount.
Direct PLUS Loan
PLUS loans are for the parents of dependent undergraduate students and for graduate/professional students. PLUS loans help pay for education expenses up to the cost of attendance minus all other financial assistance. Interest is charged during all periods.
Direct PLUS Loan for parents of dependent undergraduate students
Direct Parent PLUS loans are federally guaranteed loans that allow parents to borrow funds to pay for the educational expenses of their dependent undergraduate student. These loans are need based and parents are eligible for this loan if the child is a dependent undergraduate student as defined by the US Department of Education. Parents may borrow up to the total cost of attendance minus any other funding. The program requires the borrower (parents) to pass a simple credit check. Interest begins to accrue when funds are disbursed and repayment begins within 60 days after the loan has been fully disbursed.
Direct Graduate PLUS Loans
The Federal Graduate PLUS Loan is a low interest federally backed student loan, guaranteed by the US Government. Like its undergraduate counterpart, the Graduate PLUS Loan can be used to pay for the total cost of education less any aid you've already been awarded. Also, like the undergraduate version, eligibility for the Graduate PLUS Loan is largely dependent on the borrower's credit rating and history, as opposed to the purely financial need-based subsidized loan."
Disbursement of federal loan funds will be made in two equal instalments at the beginning of each term. The dates will be announced in the ‘Notification of Student Loan’ letter sent to you once your federal loan(s) have been processed and completed by our office.
Eligibility
First-time applicants wishing to apply for Federal Direct Loans should visit the Federal Student Aid website:
"For PLUS loans - make the application and complete a Master Promissory Note (MPN)* - As PLUS loans are subject to a credit check, MPNs for PLUS loans must be signed using a US postal address."
"For Subsidized and Unsubsidized loans - complete a Master Promissory Note (MPN) - All students taking out a federal Direct loan outside the US are required to complete a Master Promissory Note (MPN) annually before the loan funds can be disbursed. E- sign your Federal Direct loan MPN on the studentloans.gov Web site, using your Federal Student Aid ID, by selecting ""My Account"". After you log in, choose Complete MPN and then select Subsidized/Unsubsidized. Follow the four-step process listed on the studentloans.gov Web site to sign your MPN."
If you cancel your federal loan after receiving a disbursement you will be required to complete exit counseling via StudentLoans.gov.
If you get suspended or withdraw from the university
"If you received more assistance than was earned, the excess funds must be returned to the US Department of Education by you and/or the University. If you received (or the University received on your behalf) less assistance than the amount earned, you may be able to receive those additional funds as a post-withdrawal disbursement."
"If you wish to cancel your federal loan and the time frame for doing so through the University has passed, you should make a repayment directly to your lender. Your lender's details can be found on the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS). If you make a repayment within 120 days of loan disbursement, your lender will treat this as a partial or full cancellation, with the appropriate adjustment of the loan fee and interest."
"If you wish to cancel your loan, we will email you prior to each disbursement with details of the deadline for cancelling/returning loan funds through the University. In order to cancel your loan you must notify us by the specified deadline. You should also contact your college to inform them of your intention to cancel your loan. You may need to pay fees and bank charges associated with returning the funds if the payment has already been requested."
"If you withdraw from the university, get suspended, drop below half-time enrolment, or otherwise become ineligible for US Federal Loans, you must contact the Student Loan Team immediately. Under US federal law, the University is required to report any changes to your enrolment within tight timescales and, if necessary, to complete a Return to Title IV (R2T4) calculation and arrange for any ""unearned"" loan funds to be returned to the US Department of Education."
"If you're a student from the States, you can take advantage of the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program.
AUBG’s school code is G34423."
"Increase your loan
If you wish to increase your loan, please contact the AUBG Student Loan Team and send an explanation of the changes you would like to be made – e.g. additional costs that you would like to be included in your COA or an update of the amount of an existing COA component. If the increase is approved, the additional funds will be spread across your remaining disbursements for the year."
"It is common for students to borrow their full entitlement through the Subsidized/Unsubsidized loans and then top up their borrowing with the PLUS loan, so remember to complete both MPN's."
It is your responsibility to:
Key facts
Loans for U.S. Students
"notify your loan servicer of anything that affects your ability to repay your loan;

notify your loan servicer of any changes in your status, including graduation, and any changes to your name, address, or telephone number;

notify your loan servicer if you fail to enroll for the period covered by your loan;"
"Once you have completed more than 60% of the payment period, all the assistance that you were scheduled to receive for that period is considered to have been earned. As an example, if you have completed 30% of the payment period, you have earned 30% of the assistance you were originally scheduled to receive within that loan period. If you have completed 60% of the payment period, you have earned 100% of the assistance you were scheduled to receive."
Our mission is to provide educational access and opportunity for all students. We promote participation in higher education by providing programs of assistance to help bridge the gap between the cost of attending the University and the family's own resources.
"Please note that if you have an endorser on your PLUS loan, you will only be able to increase the loan up to the endorsed amount. If your endorser is willing to increase the endorsed amount to allow you to borrow a higher PLUS loan, please email the AUBG Student Loan Team."
Please note you cannot decrease your loan below the amounts already disbursed of that loan type in the current academic year.

The American University in Bulgaria School Code is G34423.

"The information on this page relates to US federal student loans only. Full information is available in the Return to Title IV Policy, but the key facts are summarized below."
"The requirements for Title IV program funds when you withdraw are separate from the University's refund policy. Therefore, you may still owe funds to the University to cover unpaid institutional charges. The University may attempt to collect any Title IV program funds from you that the University is required to return."
"The US loans team will calculate the amount of Title IV program assistance that has been earned, using a formula provided by the US Department of Education."
There are 3 stages to the PLUS application process. You must:
"Typically, the FAFSA is released in October for the upcoming year. The 2024-25 FAFSA will not become available until December 2023. An actual date has not been released yet. The Department of Education and Federal Student Aid will make an announcement once an actual release date is established. We encourage families to file as soon as it becomes available."
"Under specific conditions, a leave of absence (LOA, or suspension of studies) for less than 180 days in a 12-month period may qualify as an ""approved"" leave of absence. If you are granted an ""approved"" LOA, you are not considered to have withdrawn, and no Return calculation is required. During the LOA, the University will not charge you any additional institutional charges, your financial need will not increase, and therefore, you will not be eligible for any disbursements of federal student aid. If you are granted an approved LOA you will maintain in-school status for Title IV loan repayment purposes.
If you do not even attend initial lectures or seminars you are ineligible to receive any Title IV funds and all loan proceeds will be returned to the US Department of Education. You will be liable for any fees or outstanding balances owed to the University."
We can access your FAFSA Student Aid Report (SAR) electronically so there is no need for you to send this document to us. It is used to assess your eligibility so it is important that you review it to ensure you have made any corrections that are necessary.
"Within three working days of receiving the disbursement, AUBG will deduct a proportion for fees and accommodation, unless you are not using the loans to pay your fees. The balance will then be paid directly to you by the university within 14 days, so that you can use these funds to cover your living expenses. You must be enrolled before receiving your loan funds. You should ensure that you have sufficient funds from an alternative source to cover any costs until you receive your first disbursement."
"You must meet the criteria set by the US Department of Education in order to be eligible for US federal loans. The federal loan eligibility criteria are subject to change at the US Department of Education's discretion and are beyond the University's control. You should check the latest eligibility criteria on the Federal Student Aid website.
The university is authorized to process US Direct loans for students who are:
Citizens or permanent residents of the United States (US) and who have a valid US social security number (unless you are from the Republic of the Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, or the Republic of Palau).

You must meet the criteria set by the US Department of Education in order to be eligible for US federal loans. The federal loan eligibility criteria are subject to change at the US Department of Education's discretion and are beyond the University's control....
You will arrange repayment of federal loans directly through your loan servicer. You can check who your loan servicer is on the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS). You should always keep in contact with your loan servicer to make sure that you are up-to-date with loan repayment information.
Your student loan must be repaid. You will risk going into default if you do not make your loan payments as required by your loan servicer. Federal Student Aid offers full guidance on understanding default. You may also find the Your Federal Student Loans guide and the Federal Student Aid website useful.

Exit counseling is an effective way to prevent defaults. In-depth counseling that focuses on fully explaining repayment plans and choices that fit the borrowers’ needs is essential. Exit counseling is the opportunity to clear up any misconceptions students may have about their loan obligations and re-emphasize the consequences of default.
Family housing is currently not available on campus. Married students who can show documentation are not required to live on campus unless required by their scholarship. AUBG is committed to equal opportunities and can make arrangements for students with special needs to be accommodated either on or off campus.

"A private alternative loan is a non-federal education loan, through a private lender, typically in the student’s name and requiring a cosigner. Approval and interest rates are based on the creditworthiness of the borrower and cosigner. We advise that you investigate US federal loans before applying for a US private student loan, as federal loans are often cheaper and most American students are eligible for them. US private student loans do not enable you to borrow more funds than US federal loans."
Private Loans for US Students
"The University is willing to work with any lender who offers alternative educational loans to students enrolled at Foreign Institutions. Currently, we are aware of only one such lender, Sallie Mae, but students are advised to explore all options available to them and can opt to use any lender. If you are a current student applying for a loan for the current academic year, please email the AUBG Student Loan Team for a Cost of Attendance (COA) worksheet."
"To apply for a private loan, you must be an American student enrolled in a degree-seeking program at American University in Bulgaria. Please note, that private student loans are still limited to your Cost of Attendance similar to Direct Loans. You are allowed to hold both types of loans but the total cannot exceed your Cost of Attendance."

"Submit one letter of recommendation from a teacher, professor, guidance counselor, or an academic adviser familiar with your academic performance and potential for leadership.

"The English for Academic Purposes (EAP) program of the English Language Institute (ELI) is an intensive academic program preparing students to apply to AUBG or any other English-speaking university.
The EAP is designed to accommodate students with varying English proficiency levels. Highly qualified instructors address the students’ diverse learning needs. The curriculum covers a range of skills: reading, writing, listening, speaking and vocabulary to enhance overall English proficiency. Participation in the EAP does not guarantee a specific English proficiency level but aims to provide the necessary skills for academic success and serves as a bridge for students to smoothly transition into university-level courses taught in English.
Students can spend from one to three semesters at ELI depending on their language competencies. At the beginning of each semester all accepted students undergo an initial on-ground assessment to determine their current English proficiency level. A high percentage of students graduating from the EAP go on to become successful first year students."

The Recursive about the Elevate AUBG Demo Day
"The Tchaprachikoff Scholarship Fund provides one of the most exciting new opportunities exclusively for Bulgarian students. The unique Tchaprachikoff Scholar program provides partial funding for tuition for up to two years for Bulgarian AUBG graduates who are admitted to a graduate program in any one of the top 20 national universities in the United States or to any one of the top 20 US schools in the respective fields. Preference is given to the top 20 national universities.

"The AUBG Accelerator Program “Elevate” is a 18-week experience-and mentorship-based program designed to help AUBG students and recent graduates start and grow a business. The participating teams of two to six people have access to numerous workshops, lectures, personalized training sessions, and a mentorship network composed of experienced entrepreneurs and AUBG alumni. 
Every team gets access to an initial $2,000 grant to jump-start their development and weekly personalized sessions that guide them through the initial steps of building a start-up from an idea to a functional solution. 
The Accelerator program starts in the Fall semester and finishes with a Demo Day event at the end of Spring when the start-up teams have the chance to compete for additional funding from an investment pool of $30,000! The Demo Day takes place at the end of the Spring Semester at the AUBG campus.
Elevate Seasons 1, 2, 3 and 4 welcomed 26 start-up teams in total, and In the pursuit of developing their ideas, each team went through interactive workshops, one-on-one mentor sessions, SCRUM meetings, and countless hours of work. All of that was possible thanks to the support of 30+ generous donors as well as active participants from the AUBG community! 
The last year’s Season 4 started on November 7th, 2022, and welcomed six new start-ups! And as the teams continue to develop their ideas. The Demo Day happened on 25th April 2023 and introduced a new generation of solutions for Blagoevgrad and beyond!"

A few words to all of you who are here today:
"A well-deserved “Congratulations!” For being here, for sharing this moment, and for making it to the finish line!"
Academic Procession
Academic Regalia
"After my freshman year, I went to the United States to Work and Travel. Two discoveries shocked me. First, while the standard of living there truly was higher, the difference was much smaller than I had thought. Bulgaria is not vastly inferior to the Western nations, as is commonly believed here, and it is actually catching up quickly. Second, although I was getting along quite well with my colleagues, I felt out of place. Even in a country of immigrants, I felt like a foreigner. I was in my dream nation, yet I had nostalgia."
"After the summer, we started our final year as different people. Some have never been happier physically coming back to AUBG. Some felt like they’d outgrown this place. Some just stayed online. But even then, these people kept coming here for weekends or club events to still be part of our community."

All members of the academic procession are provided with a bottle of mineral water under each of their seats during the ceremony.
"All those four years of fun, struggle, fighting our fears, and trying to make sense of what was happening in our lives led us to this day. We deserved this little moment of fame being here and coming on this stage in front of everyone. So I would like to ask every graduate to smile. I know it is hot, your shoes are not comfy and the hat is making your head heavy. But this is the moment that we fought for. Feel proud of yourself and know that you deserved it. Today is the day when we celebrate ourselves. Congratulations, Class of 2019!"
"Also, thank you to our amazing faculty, staff, and administration. You were there beyond your working hours, helping the students who asked many questions, the students who did not know what they were doing, and those students who never showed up for classes. And you still kept patient. We should all indeed celebrate your patience. And your input into our future. Once again, thank you!"
"Although nobody in my family had been to the United States, I was confident this was the “land of opportunity” for me. Admission into a prestigious US university became my life’s purpose and I worked hard toward achieving it. With Ivy League test scores, I thought success was inevitable. By January 2013, I had applied to eight universities, ranked top 50 in the world. For no apparent reason, I also applied to AUBG on the last day of early admission, even though I was certain I would never end up coming here."
"Anastasiya Pantsialei, 3.98, Belarus, JMC and PSY"
"And as a final note, I want us to remember that this moment right now will not last forever. Soon we will be showing mere photos of ourselves dressed in these gowns to our children and grandchildren and the memory of today will have dissolved. We shouldn’t forget that the most powerful force in our lives is the relationships we have with other people. Let’s not lose the ones we have today and let’s not lose the will to nourish them and create new ones in the future. We are about to all depart on different paths. Some of us will become directors of banks, and others might become schoolteachers or do administrative work back in our countries."
"And as we leave today this wonderful place that became home for us and will join other communities and enter new great places, let’s always remember and cherish the memories we have made here. Let’s always look back at our time at AUBG with big smiles on our faces. And as we are to go on many adventures and discoveries, let’s not forget what this place taught us. Let’s never be afraid. Let’s try to make an impact in our new communities, let’s try to share our knowledge there, stay true to ourselves and show our greatness to the rest of the world. I would like to end my speech with a well-known quote from Dr. Seuss: “You’re off to great places, Today is your day! Your mountain is waiting… So get on your way!” Thank you! Congratulations and best of luck, Class of 2019!"
"And on this sentimental note, I would also like to thank our friends. I have heard people say that the friends you make in college are to stay with you forever. And I sincerely hope for that to be true. All of us no matter our nationality, background, social status, and preferences found someone here who could understand us. We found someone who could support us, make fun of our silly mistakes, tap on our shoulders when we felt empty, and share our moments of happiness and the moments when we preferred to stay in silence. So let’s thank our friends, best friends, roommates, second roommates, and fellow club members, all those who made these four years truly unforgettable and worthy. Thank you, friends!"
"And perhaps, the power to love, to see endless possibilities no matter where we are, is what makes all those sleepless nights worth it after all."
"And with this, I wish that the graduating class preserves its uniqueness. I feel honored to know
and excited to see us all continue to exude Ambition, Resilience, and Compassion beyond the
AUBG campus."
"Anna Ilcheva, 3.98, Bulgaria, COS and INF"

"Artem Eremin, 4.00, Russia, BUS and INF"
"As I come to a close, I want to take this moment to thank the people, who have guided us in their
unique ways. The faculty, the staff, and everyone else we’ve encountered during this wonderfully
hectic AUBG experience."
"As I first entered AUBG, I found it small. Indeed, it was small and young, just like we all were 4 years ago. I met my class, who were all excited and full of energy, ready to step out of the club at 8 am in the morning to get ready for the 9 am lecture in the main building. A week later, I got to see everyone else, the sophomores coming back from their first summer since college started: twice as confident, but not less excited, and very willing to be our guides. I saw the juniors returning enriched and full of plans and ideas. I also saw some seniors hiding behind the doors of Skaptopara 3, acting all grumpy and unsociable toward the immature and foolish freshmen. I cannot believe we are those guys today. I cannot believe all those amazing people have already left. I cannot believe we are the ones leaving now."
AUBG Commencement 2023

"AUBG gave us opportunities. All of us at some point found ourselves in a club or activity, where we met people who shared our passions and interests. If there wasn’t something already on campus, it was created by one of you. Most of us came to university not knowing our purpose in life, be it professionally or in general. Here we began the search of finding our purpose and I am almost sure that search began in one of your 2am conversations with a friend in Skapto. Relationships are a powerful force.
They say you learn a lot of things about yourself and others during university. What did I learn? I learned that it doesn’t matter where you are but who you are with. Blagoevgrad is an amazing place, and I hope you grew to appreciate it throughout your stay here, but it is not Blagoevgrad that makes it amazing, it’s the people that live here, it is us the students, and you - the faculty. That means that wherever you are in the world if you aren’t with the right people, nothing else will make sense. Of course, we also learned everyday survival skills such as being careful how we enter one of the Skaptos at 4 am in the morning because we are not sure what we might find on the floor, or what we might smell. Names such as Frame, Kebab 13, Piano Bar, The Canteen, OCC, and phrases such as “Mozhe li Taxi za Skapto 1?” will remain in our memories but these moments would not mean a thing if you hadn’t shared them with the people sitting next to you today. As the film of your AUBG experience plays in your head right now, you smile with happiness because you know that these moments were shared with your friends. Relationships are a powerful force."

"But, we all know that being a part of the AUBG community is not about being scared or intimidated by something. For four years, we have continuously proven that we definitely do not get scared so easily. Six-hour-long exams, 9 am classes after a night out, presenting ourselves at the job fair, turnitin.com not loading at 11:58 pm, learning a semester’s worth of Statistics in one night. We have embraced and fought all the challenges successfully and that is why today we are all here, so cute, dressed up in these oversized gowns and silly square caps on our heads."
"By looking both at students who are now online and at us here adjusting to a constantly changing situation, we realized what makes AUBG a place to be, even if we can’t really be here."
"Caps have evolved into a distinctive square shape but were originally round. The shape resembles the tool workers use to hold cement and plaster in the construction of a building, so these caps are called “mortarboards.”"

"Dayana Panova, 3.98, Bulgaria, ECO and MAT"
"Dear AUBG family members, honored guests,"
"Dear donors, you are the reason this institution started, and the reason it still holds. Thank you for allowing us to live what some of you have already lived. Thank you for being part of this big project and allowing us all to join it."
"Dear faculty, friends, family, distinguished guests,"
"Dear faculty, thank you so much for teaching us with all your passion and dedication, and not so much for scheduling those classes at 9 am sometimes. During a 9 am lecture, my Corporate Finance professor once admitted: “I am very productive during the late hours, in fact, I am teaching this class in the middle of the night.” Thank you for not giving up on us, and thank you for the change you brought to us."
"Dear fellow graduates,"
"Dear friends of AUBG,"
"Dear graduates of the class of 2016, you should be extremely proud of yourselves today. You have achieved a lot over the past years and we should be thankful for the education we acquired at this institution. If there is one thing being at AUBG taught me was that wonderful, energetic, and determined people can be found anywhere."
"Dear Parents, Faculty, Staff, Students,"
"Dear parents, faculty, staff, students, alumni, dear AUBG friends,"
"Dear parents, members of faculty and administration, Board of Trustees representatives,"
"Dear parents, thank you for supporting our journey, thank you for being pushers without being pushy, and thank you for proudly carrying our pictures where you once used to carry money. I hope you are all proud of us, and that you become prouder of what is to become of us."
"Dear students... well… I should call you graduates now. Thank you for being each other’s companions. Thank you for making it sounds like it is not all only about studying, for joining clubs, for organizing so many activities and events, for bringing music and life to this place, and making it feel truly diverse and international, for making not only brilliant students but also excellent members of the community. Our bonding is eternal. We have marked our existence in each other’s minds and hearts, and we have marked our existence in this school. We are now a reflection of what this institution is, so let us give back our best."

"Good afternoon, dear members of the faculty, administration, members of the Board of Trustees, parents and friends, honored guests, and, most importantly, the Class of 2019! I feel very honored to be here today, first of all, graduating at this magnificent Commencement ceremony, but also delivering my speech in front of all of you. I will be even more proud of myself if this speech inspires you at least a tiny bit. So bear with me and, hopefully, some of my words can make you smile, laugh or maybe even cry, who knows?"
"Graduates’ parents do not receive their guest tickets along with their invitations. Seniors may pick up their family members' tickets from the Commencement Welcome Center (10 a.m. – 6 p.m. at the Aspire Hub) on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday before the ceremony. All guests should bring their guest tickets, as they will provide access to the seating area at the Commencement Ceremony. This will help our student assistants guide you to your seats."
Holders of Schengen visas and residence permits do not need a Bulgarian short-stay visa to enter and reside in Bulgaria for a period of no more than three months in any six-month period from the date of first entry.
"Hoods, which hang on the back of the robe, are now mere abbreviations of their original form; they began as cowls to be pulled over the head for warmth. The color of the hood indicates the area of study pursued by the wearer and the university attended."
"However, I was wrong! During Orientation Week, interacting with other students, many of whom had a similar background to mine, I saw light in the tunnel. These were diligent young people with a passion for doing something meaningful with their lives. It occurred to me this passion was what I had longed for all along. Moreover, I had found it in the last place I expected – within the borders of my own country."
"Hristo Vasilev, 3.98, Bulgaria, ECO"
"I am not saying it will be easy, but the things worth living for rarely are. Fighting for a greater cause gives meaning to life. It takes strength to forfeit personal gain to serve others but true fulfillment comes from helping those in need, often at your own expense. Do you want to be a hero in your own country or another brick in the wall somewhere else? The choice is yours."
"I don’t know what will happen to us when we leave AUBG. But I know for sure that we took everything we could from here to prepare for our life after. Today, let’s not think about our next steps and who we’ll become in the future. Instead, let’s just imagine. Let’s imagine becoming somebody more original than we were, more unique than we were, and more well-defined than just a fearless explorer or a creative visionary."
"I welcome you to the commencement ceremony of the AUBG graduate class of 2015, the 21st class of AUBG graduates."
"I will start with a confession. Four years ago, AUBG was not my first choice for my undergraduate studies. Living as an ambitious student in the provincial town of Gabrovo, I was disillusioned by the general idleness of the majority of my peers. Coupled with pressure from my family and friends, as early as 10th grade, I had the conviction that the only way to reach my full potential was to emigrate to a developed country for life."
"If Professor Eastergard were here, he would probably have given me an A in accounting for saying that those people are the most valuable asset on our personal balance sheet. Professor White would say that it is the most ethical thing in the world to take care of those people as if they were our own family. Professor Phillips would argue that protecting those friendships is the key to a successful and prosperous democracy in our countries, and Professor Bonev would say that this is the only correct algorithm in C++."
"Iliyana Nalbantova, 3.98, Bulgaria, POS"
Imagine.
"In a world, that demands benefit, productivity, effectiveness and efficiency, we’ll use the love that we have learned. It will urge us to take the ordinary and look for the extraordinary."
"In addition, one of the professors said, “Why would you want to emigrate to the United States? Back in Bulgaria, you have countless more opportunities to start a successful business and make an impact on society. In the US, everything has already been commercialized and there is stiff competition in all industries. In your country, however, there are numerous ideas that have not been realized. If you just copy a business model from here and adapt it to the Bulgarian market, you could be thriving in a matter of months.”"
"In no world did we imagine AUBG through a screen. And yet, more than ever, home and university
became synonymous. Some of us literally brought AUBG home on our laptops in our old rooms,
others spent unimaginable times in the Skapto dorms, attending classes just a few meters away
from our real classrooms. We quickly adapted to what life had become and we got the most of
it. The Zoom breakout rooms became the new library study rooms. We flooded Facebook with
so many online events that it was hard to see what your mother’s greetings post was for the day.
We readjusted what we once knew and have now set the groundwork for any future Lions and
Eagles. And all of this is not everything that we have achieved here."
"In order to preserve those friendships and relationships, we must never forget where we came from and always remember the people that helped us on our journey. We owe eternal gratitude to you, our parents and family, who supported us in our crazy endeavors, who scolded us when we were on the wrong track, and most importantly, who gave us the freedom to dream, to act, and to make our own mistakes."
"In our final year we saw how AUBG truly is about the community. A war was waged against our
friends and families not far away from here. And that’s when it happened. We came together
more than we ever have before. We spoke up, we coordinated our efforts, we showed support
and did everything in our abilities to keep people reassured. Reassured that, here, at AUBG,
anyone can find their home, their solace, and their backbone."
"In the event of light rain, the ceremony remains outdoors, and guests and participants are advised to be prepared for such weather."
"Ina Gjika, 3.98, Albania, BUS and POS"
"Instead of running away from the problems of my country, why not try to solve them? Rather than complaint about the situation, why not change it myself? I already know what the issues are and how people here think. Instead of expecting the government to fix my life, why not take this responsibility into my own hands? Rather than say, “What can my country do for me?” why not consider, “What can I do for my country?”"

"It is difficult to step outside your comfort zone. It is difficult to make the choice to leave your home and come live in a new town. We all know that it takes courage to get used to a new place and to begin creating memories in it. I really understand the feeling because until now in my life I have lived long-term in three different countries. Once you are all settled in, having to leave that place is even harder. Each time I left I had to say goodbye to friendships and memories. Today we are experiencing the same thing. We have to say goodbye to a place that was dear to us for the past few years. What I always noticed when leaving was how difficult it was to say goodbye to people. Our memories are constructed through experiences shared with others and we do not want to let go of them. Relationships with people are a powerful force."
"It symbolizes the completion of a course of study and the conferral of the degree. Begun in the Middle Ages, the ceremony involves many venerable traditions, including the wearing of “academic regalia.” The colored gowns, hoods, capes, and tassels and the distinctive caps and mortarboards evolved from attire worn when Commencement was still a religious ceremony associated with ordination. As educational institutions became more secular, clothing took on a new significance. Today the colors and designs symbolize the degree, the field of study, and frequently the university granting the degree."
"It’s difficult to imagine, but since last March, a lot of us have discovered more about ourselves than during the previous three years at AUBG. We were scared. We were brave. We matured. And unlike before, we did all of this on our own, in our apartments or empty rooms in Skapto, without friends, professors, or staff members to help us."

Kristian Petrov (’23): Commencement Speech
"Last in the procession is the Stage Party comprised of the President of AUBG, the Keynote Commencement Speaker, the Honorary Degree Recipient(s), the Chair and the Deputy Chair of the Board of Trustees, the Provost, the Student Speaker, the Presidential Medalist, the Valedictorian(s) and the Salutatorian(s) of the graduating class, and some Bulgarian and US government officials. The Stage Party is led onto the stage by the President wearing the University Medallion. All other members of the academic procession and the whole audience should remain standing while the stage party is processing. The President presides over the Commencement Ceremony."
"Last year, AUBG chose this word as a slogan for its new marketing campaign. “Imagine becoming a brave leader.” “Imagine becoming a creative visionary.” “Just imagine.”"
"Let us also give advice and assistance to those younger than us, and to all of our friends that still journeying on their AUBG adventure. Lend them a helping hand when they need it most. Be there for them, as those that came before we were there for us."
Let’s share that happiness now.
Location
"Love that provoked our families to let us leave home and come here from every corner of the country and the world to pursue our passions! Love that brought us here on this day! Love that our professors have been teaching us without our knowledge! We have learned not only how to think, but also what the importance of this love is. We have learned that for something to be meaningful it doesn’t need a function."
"Love. This wasn’t the verb I would have used to express how I felt about the long sleepless nights, the group projects, the morning classes, the club meetings, the drama with the first boyfriend, the second boyfriend, the thir… OK, you get the point. It wasn’t love. It felt silly to think of love as a vital part of our time at university."
Love? I thought. Love was definitely not what I felt while running from Main Building to BAC and back to Main Building.

More about the Bulgarian visa procedure
"More than a year ago, we couldn’t imagine attending classes from home and being unable to participate in any event. We couldn’t imagine getting summer internships and part-time jobs instead of going to Work & Travel. Some international students couldn’t imagine spending the summer at the Bulgarian seaside because the borders were closed. And yet, all of this happened to us."

"My last words will be directed towards you, you wild, wild world! No matter what you have in store for us, all the good and bad things, be careful, because the class of 2014 is ready to face your challenges, and we will face them together."
"My plea is to those of you wondering whether to emigrate and even to those who have already made this decision. Think of how much your home countries have given you. Remember all the pleasant memories of your childhood. Think of your families and friends. Do you not want to give something back? The developed world does not need your help. It will do fine without you. But you are the brightest minds of your nations. If you do not help them, who would?"
Next in the procession are the AUBG Board of Trustees led by the Board Marshal and seated behind the faculty in the reserved seating area. Their order of march is also random.
"Nikoleta Stefanova, Bulgaria, JMC"
"No matter how you evaluate your time spent at AUBG, you will always hold memories of moments shared with others. I am sure you all remember the first days of orientation and the disorientation you felt as you struggled to get used to your new home. However soon that changed as we fell into social circles and created friendships with people from all over the world. We shared our lives with each other during our time here, we learned things about others we couldn’t have learned anywhere else. Prejudices and wrong perceptions of others were torn. As humans, we all carry judgments about others. Mine were of the sort that all Balkan people were the same or that nothing good can come out of Bulgaria. Those soon began to leave me. Because once you talk to a person and discover so much about them, it’s hard to continue to judge them. All that is left is to find a connection with that person because you know that you yourself are not perfect. No matter where you come from. Relationships are a powerful force."
"No. It’s about these two-three people that you met in your Exposition course, who then became your best friends. It’s about this one professor you hated at first, who then turned into your favorite one. It’s about these weekly club meetings that you kept attending no matter how busy you were and where you were."
"Note: Citizens of Albania, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine would not need a Bulgarian visa if they have biometric passports."
"Now let us all celebrate, for there is life after graduation, and it is neither better nor worse, it is just….different. A new chapter begins. Thank you!"
"Now my dear professors, I can feel your stare lingering at me right now, as perhaps you think I am going to forget to mention you and the academic part of why we all came to university in the first place. Knowledge is a powerful force as well. Without knowledge, we would not possess the capabilities to make rational well-calculated decisions in our lives. I am in no way undermining knowledge and all that we learned in our classes. But I am sure that you would all agree with me today that titles, numbers, and theories do not have the power to make a person happy or successful. We, as students, know very well that upon choosing who to take a class with, we always took into consideration your energy, your desire to teach, and your individual personality. Okay, and perhaps maybe your grading criteria as well. But it is the relationships that we built with you over the years that will remain mostly in our memories from now on. All your time and effort invested in making sure we understood that last bit of theory in class is what we are most thankful for. And, of course, the conversations with you around campus about what food you are feeding your pets at home or the books you are currently reading. We appreciate those moments so much; please never stop giving them to your students. Thank you, esteemed Professors."
"Now, when I think about what would be beneficial for the graduates to hear, I think of the same words: “Do not be afraid!” Indeed, all of us now are starting the next page of our book called “Life” and moving forward into the very much exciting adult world. Those four years have slipped by very fast and apparently now is the time to move on again. We are about to step into the world full of opportunities and offers but the abundance of those is not only exciting but also scary. And truly, as a graduate, those are the words I need right now: “Don’t be afraid.” Don’t be afraid to make mistakes, don’t be afraid to apply for a job of your dreams, don’t be afraid to pursue another degree, don’t be afraid to step into new relationships, don’t be afraid to go on the journey of your life and don’t be afraid to chase your dreams."
"Nowadays three types of robes are distinguished for the bachelor’s, master’s, and doctoral degrees. The doctoral robe has three stripes on the sleeve as an indication of this highest academic degree."
"One April evening, the decisions of the universities in the States arrived in my inbox. My dreams were shattered. All eight institutions informed me that despite my qualifications, they could not offer me the financial aid I needed to afford their education. Ironically, a week later came the letter from AUBG – I was admitted on a full scholarship. Reluctantly, I told the Admission Office I would accept the offer. Traveling to Blagoevgrad in August, I was thinking about how I would have to endure four more years of what I had experienced in high school."
"One year later, I returned to the US for an entrepreneurship program at the top university in the field. We visited a Bulgarian start-up in Palo Alto and I was astonished when one software developer told me, “When Bulgarians consider emigrating to the States, they look at the salaries, which are admittedly much higher. However, they usually forget the cost of living is also much higher than in Bulgaria. The standard of living I can afford in California is the same, if not lower, than the one I would be able to maintain working back home.”"
"Palina Kovlani, 3.99, Belarus, BUS and POS"
Parking
"Perhaps one of the most important relationships we have in our lives is the one with our parents. We thank you sincerely parents for supporting us over the past years with everything you had. I think you should be extremely proud of your son or daughter sitting here today. Thank you once again, dear Parents."
Please be informed that Svoboda Batchvarova St. will be off-limit for vehicles with no Parking passes on Commencement day from 6:00 a.m. until 6:30 p.m.
Please note that the commencement invitation IS NOT A TICKET for the ceremony.
"Please plan to arrive in Blagoevgrad one hour prior to the ceremony to park your car and find your seat. A few minutes before the beginning of the Ceremony, the reserved seating area will be closed off, in order for the academic processional to begin."
Procession
"Recently I have been asked what advice I would give to freshmen. And I answered that the biggest advice I could give to my freshman self is “Do not be afraid”. Don’t be afraid of trying new things, applying to all those clubs, talking to people you see for the first time, taking advantage of opportunities, and challenging yourself. I think that is what every freshman should hear as a word of support before starting this new stage of their lives as university students."
Recession
"Reflecting on these two visits to America, I had an epiphany. There really was no reason for me to emigrate. If I do not become a millionaire, I would not be much better off materially. It would take me years to understand the mentality of the nation I would live in, and I would still not be able to integrate fully. I would leave behind many close friends and relatives to go to a place where I would have no one. How could this be worth it?"
Regalia Elements
"Reserved seating for students’ guests at the ceremony will be ensured by commencement guest tickets (no more than two per graduate), which graduates may pick up from the Commencement Welcome Center in Aspire Hub on the ground floor of America for Bulgaria Student Center. The Welcome Center will work on Wednesday through Saturday prior the ceremony starting at 10:00 a.m. until 6:00 p.m."
Scholarship and a Special Distinction in Honor of H.R.H. Princess Maria-Luisa of Bulgaria
Second in the procession are AUBG faculty led by the Faculty Marshal carrying the University Mace. Faculty are seated behind the EMBA graduates in the reserved seating area. Faculty order of march is random.
"Should there be severe weather, the ceremony will take place at America for Bulgaria Student Center. If there is any uncertainty as to the ceremony location because of unstable weather announcements regarding the place of the Ceremony will be posted around campus and in AUBG Main Building."
"Since 1991, two symbols have expressed the ideals held by the American University in Bulgaria, the University Medallion and the University Mace. They both have Thracian origins after the ancient inhabitants of the lands along the Struma river. The design of both symbols is the original creation of Mr. Hristo Apostolov, a local artist."
"So do not be afraid to walk out there in the big world and find what you want to do, what you want to be and fight for it. And it is ok if you do not really know what to do. It is ok to try and it is completely ok to fail. AUBG gave us knowledge, experience, and resources that we can use in the future to figure things out. We should not be afraid of giving it a try, we should break the external limitations and never be fooled by the limitations in our own heads. We have the power and knowledge to make our dreams come true."
"So, class of 2014, let us show the world how strong we are! Let us never forget where we came from and never forget to dream. Because, we, WE are AUBG. Thank you!"
"So, what makes the Class of 2022 unique?"
"Some long nights against the procrastination ago, desperately running to a class, a Resident Assistant friend stopped me and gave me a letter to self from our Orientation Week. I had written, “Fall in love”. I laughed at what I read."

"Such a simple word, even one to make fun of, and yet, it now has become meaningful."
"Tassels are generally worn on the left side of the cap to indicate the degree has been conferred, so all faculty wear theirs on the left. Graduating students begin their Commencement ceremony with tassels on the right but move them to the left when their degrees are awarded."
"Thank you for joining us on this very special day for us. Not only it is the twentieth class to graduate from AUBG, but also, most importantly, it is our day. A day that marks the beginning of a new journey."
"Thank you to all our friends and family, for supporting our efforts and vicariously experiencing
AUBG throughout our four years here."
Thank You!
"Thank you, members of the leadership and everyone else working here – librarians, cleaning
and canteen ladies, and all the other friendly faces, who shape the AUBG family and will continue
to care for the generations to come the same way they have for us."
"Thank you, professors, for smiling your way through the endless pleas for permission codes at
the beginning of every semester, for being flexible and patient, for the precious moments of pep
talks when the semester gets rough."
Thank you.
"The Academic Procession is composed of the Stage Party, Board of Trustees, Faculty members, and Graduating Seniors, appropriately attired in academic regalia."
"The AUBG Commencement Ceremony will take place on AUBG Skaptopara Campus, between Balkanski Academic Center and America for Bulgaria Student Center."
"The Class of 2022 is unique.
And I don’t mean this in the reassuring way that mothers say it to their kids.
The Class of 2022 is so unique that this ceremony alone will not suffice to capture it all.
It gives me great honor to stand in front of you all today – faculty, staff, friends, and family. A
moment awaited by so many for so long. When I was a freshman 2022 sounded like a lifetime
away. And in some ways, it has been a lifetime. A lifetime worth of events. Events that brought
us some of our happiest and saddest moments. Moments that made us the most vulnerable and
the most empowered. We are all standing here today with the perspective of the four years
behind us. A vibrant community of people. Similar to the ones we were in 2018, and yet different
in the most special ways."
The Commencement ceremony is a symbolic landmark in your educational career.
"The core of love is to find great happiness in something or someone for what it simply is. This love isn’t a strange concept I’ve come up with. It is something AUBG inspires us to feel. Something, we have all experienced."
"The first group in the procession are the graduating seniors led by the Student Marshal. Bachelor Graduates are seated on the first several rows of the reserved seating area both if the ceremony takes place outside, and indoors. EMBA Graduates are seated behind the BA Graduates both outdoors and indoors. The candidates for degrees remain standing while faculty, trustees, and stage party proceed to their places. Graduating seniors order of march is alphabetical. It is of crucial importance that students stay in line, since diplomas are in the same order."
"The mission of AUBG is “to educate students of outstanding potential in a community of academic excellence, diversity, and respect and to prepare them for democratic and ethical leadership in serving the needs of the region and the world.” I believe the university has fulfilled its part in this mission by providing us with the knowledge and skills to make a difference. Now it is time for us, the graduating students, to take the initiative."
"The order of recession after the ceremony is reverse of the procession: Stage Party, Board of Trustees, Faculty members, Graduates."
"The pandemic has changed a lot in AUBG's experience, but it didn’t define it. When everything was closed, we kept finding ways to meet with friends, to see new people, to express our creativity, embrace who we are, and continue our AUBG experience – whether we were on campus or not. Last March, we couldn’t imagine a lot of these things to happen to us. But more interestingly, a year ago, we couldn’t imagine that students, staff members, professors, and all of us would still continue bringing so much life to this place.
Even after going completely online, even after closing the buildings, and even after limiting every single activity on campus, we still wanted to come here. And we stayed here because it wasn’t our time to leave this place."
"The robes, hoods, caps, and tassels worn by graduates and faculty have evolved over at least 700 years. Originally, robes similar to those seen today were worn by everyone in the early Middle Ages. As tastes in clothing changed, only members of the clergy retained traditional robes. The first European universities were church-related, so students and faculty wore clerical robes on all occasions."
The University Mace is borne by the Faculty Marshall. A pair of Thracian stalwart griffins protect the American University in Bulgaria; their tails point to the two respective countries on the Earth. The Bulgarian-American partnership is further reflected in the text portraying Cyrillic and Latin bodies of knowledge. The mace is made of walnut for its durability.
"The University Medallion is worn by the President. Its circular shape declares that there is no end to learning. The Sun of Enlightenment shines on the Horse of Grace, the Lion of Power, and the Owl of Wisdom."
"The visa procedure is required for citizens from the following countries: Albania, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Mongolia, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Ukraine."
"These moments of love may have been completely unrelated to school. We might have felt the unconditional joy of going to the banichka place late at night, because…finals week makes us exceptionally hungry. Or the late-night trips from Underground to Skapto, which I will only mention without any details. We felt it in the long conversations we had even though we had met to study. Yes, study… We have created friendships. We have bonded. We have built this great happiness together. We have found the love."
"These moments will remind us of the countless forms of loving. And by carrying this love, we let AUBG stay with us forever!"
"Throughout my journey in this institution, I met so many people coming out of all classes of graduates, from 1995 to 2014. Graduate students, businessmen, politicians, professors, developers, writers, journalists, and members of the Board of Trustees. I stumbled upon so many of them, all different. Yet, they all asked me the same questions: “How are things at AUBG going? Is this professor still teaching? Do students still go to this nightclub?” Getting to know all those individuals during my 4 years of undergraduate studies, reassured me: This institution is indeed still young and small, but it has such a big family. And this is what makes it so special: it's a great AUBG alumni family, and we are all here today to become part of it."
"Today marks the last day that we might formally call ourselves students at AUBG. But even though our ID cards and AUBG e-mails would no longer work, we will always carry AUBG in our hearts and soul."
"Today we do not only celebrate the graduating class. We should also celebrate the people who helped us become who we are. Look around. Those people are sitting there in the far back, taking pictures of you and feeling nervous just like they felt when you were born. For them, not only these four years but probably past twenty-and-something years flew by with a speed of light. Do not forget to thank them today. Tell them that this was also their achievement. And let’s celebrate it together. So on the behalf of the Class of 2019, dear parents and families, thank you for your continuous support and for being there whenever we needed you."
Today we see that the spirit of AUBG is not about Under Thursdays or Challenging Wednesdays.

"We came here hoping to experience everything that constitutes AUBG. And nobody really knew
what that would be. As freshmen, we set off on this journey of bold endeavors. We established
new clubs, we rebuilt others, we quickly left our mark. We dove right in and did not look back.
We immersed ourselves in the world of Olympiads, conferences, ceremonies, projects, and
parties. And it was unlike anything else. Once the year was over, we took all this enthusiasm and
we brought it to our first Work&Travel or our first internship at our dream company. Then our
sophomore and junior years showed us something different."
"We felt this love late at night while studying in a lobby. We felt it while waiting for permission for classes. And while talking to professors for an hour, even though they gave you a 10-minute slot. We felt it as we looked forward to another team building. And when we knew we have midterms and presentations, but still hung out with friends."
"We have all met in one way or another – be it in a classroom, a student club, or another kind of club. Some of us will meet again at a workplace, others will start mutual ventures, or create families. We are stepping out of AUBG braver, freer, and better."
"We have been told that reason is the way to the truth, right? And we have preferred logic, not passion or love, to engage in heated discussions. But as today approached, I felt this ache in my heart as I knew I’ll have to fly away from AUBG. I realized I am in love. It has been love this whole time!"
"We have to promise ourselves that we will never let go of our freshman spirit – overly energetic and excited, jumping into every new opportunity that we saw. We left home and dived into unknown waters. If you find yourself stuck, not moving forward, just remind yourself of your first freshman day, dragging your suitcase to your dorm room, and the courage that it took. Remind yourself that everything was within your reach and then say to yourself that it still is. Because we have friends to help us keep moving forward. Because we will always have AUBG at our side."
"We might not remember the best marketing strategy or how to apply quantitative methods in economics. Instead, we will remember the moments of love."
"We must never be afraid to dream. Someone once told me that if you do not look at the stars, you will never get there. So let us keep our gaze looking towards the sky, as we did on those warm spring days around campus. I am certain all of us will face hardships. But despite that, no matter how rough and tough everything might be, promise yourself and everybody around you that you will keep your eyes on the stars and dream. So let us dream, so we can make a difference together."
We will always need other people in our lives to share the journey with. Happiness is only real when shared.

Those that we have dreamt with."

"There is hardly a sphere of human activity that doesn’t depend on technology to make it run efficiently. Ambitious undergraduates increasingly opt for computer science because of its potential for making an impact and changing lives.


Computer science is a fast-growing field offering a wide array of career options to students, from scientific inquiry and technical excellence to entrepreneurial and business ventures (and AUBG Computer Science graduates have themselves founded successful technology enterprises both in Bulgaria and abroad.) 


Our department works in close cooperation with the computing industry, as well as with other universities and alumni, to provide a modern and challenging curriculum. Students have many interest clubs, hosting workshops, competitions and industry events."

In doing so, AUBG reserves the right to obtain, copy and examine AUBG-owned equipment."
"1.1. The website www.aubg.edu is the official AUBG website. In addition to this website, AUBG provides web space and web services under addresses of the form: /aubg.edu and /aubg.bg and all their subdivisions, to various entities within the AUBG community. These entities include students, faculty, student organizations, academic projects and courses, and AUBG departments. For the purposes of this policy all the websites having “aubg.bg” in their name, apart from the official AUBG website will be designated as non-official websites supported by AUBG. The content of these websites is the property of their owners, but has to be compatible with the Mission of AUBG."

"1.3 If a concern or complaint emerges related to improper use of University IT infrastructure, a designated administrator (such as OCC personnel) has the right to review the contents of a computer memory and storage, trace information, backups, file server accounts, or any central multi-user computer account contents, to determine extent of involvement. Circumstances under which such action may be necessary include but are not limited to:"
"1.3.1. When required by and consistent with law;
1.3.2. When there is reason to believe that violations of law or of this Policy or any other AUBG policies have occurred;

"1.6 Network and system administrators are expected to treat the contents of electronic files and network communications as private and confidential. No person outside OCC may review the entire contents of an account's system mailbox without authorization of the Provost. OCC administers the campus electronic mail system in a manner consistent with the system's importance for campus communication and the need for privacy of e-mail messages. In the process of administering the electronic mail system, certain members of the OCC staff will, of necessity, have access to the contents of certain e-mail messages. The OCC staff members will exercise their ability to access the contents of e-mail under the strict limitations of the system administration requirements (a need to know basis). Furthermore, information about the contents of e-mail obtained by members of the staff as they administer the e-mail system must not be communicated to other members of the OCC staff unless required to administer and support the system, and never be communicated to anyone outside OCC without the approval of the Provost."

"2.4. Electronic mail is private and owned by the sender and each recipient account holder. The use of each account is the personal responsibility of the account holder. The contents of electronic mail will not be monitored, altered, or otherwise examined except with specific authorization and direction by the Provost or as part of the required system administration as described below."
"2.5 Certain circumstances may require that OCC take extraordinary action in administering the e-mail system. This might be caused by such events as system malfunction or malicious actions by an individual. OCC must take steps to: - protect the privacy of mail, - protect the functionality of the electronic mail system, - protect account holders from disruption of their use of the electronic mail system."
2.5. Assignment of SO website names is made on a first come – first served basis with AUBG reserving the right of denying certain names based on its interests.
"2.6 A large volume of unread mail being received by an account can cause network and mail performance problems, in addition to storage problems, with no benefit to anyone. In cases where, over a period of a week or longer, an account has received a large volume of mail and the account holder is not moving it out of the mailbox, OCC will implement stages of response to protect the performance of the e-mail system, and help the account holder gain control over the amount of mail being received."
2.7 Backup copies of e-mail could be retrieved even after discarding of the electronic mail personal record. The backup process results in the copying of data onto storage media that may be retained for periods of time and in locations unknown to the originator or recipient of electronic mail. The practice and frequency of backups and the retention of backup copies of e-mail vary from system to system.
"2.8 AUBG does not maintain central or distributed electronic mail archives. Electronic mail back-up is aimed at assuring system integrity and reliability and preventing potential loss of data, and does not provide for future retrieval."
"2.9 AUBG’s policies on electronic resources do not apply outside AUBG’s local network. AUBG does not have direct influence on handling e-mail anywhere outside the local network.

"We live in a globalizing, digitalizing, integrating, disintegrating, trade liberalizing, resource-depleting, climate changing, migrating, warring, peace-making world.
It can be difficult to make sense of it. All the same, you have this nagging feeling that it somehow affects you.
That’s because it does. And it will continue to do so. Our European Politics and Political Science & International Relations programs will help you make better sense of the world. With a stronger understanding of political forces, you’ll be able to approach problems from fresh viewpoints, see through mental walls and develop solutions that others may miss.
So whether you end up working in a multinational corporation, running your own business, serving your government in a ministry, building Europe in Brussels, tackling global issues in an international organization or leading social change in an NGO, you’ll need a developed framework to better understand the world and practical skills to help you travel upon your life path. To build these, our students learn and engage both in and out of the classroom. They also participate in exchange programs at European and American universities, intern in government and NGOs, take the floor at AUBG’s annual Model United Nations simulation and discuss current events in the Political Science Club."

The naming of buildings and landmarks is secured for a period of time. But if your name or company is among the creators of a film, you stay associated with its story for generations, as long as that film exists.
Our film tells a universal story of brave people with a vision of defeating overwhelming odds to transform their world. It is a true story: a documentary about the establishment of the American University in Bulgaria.
Distilling the stories and circumstances into a compelling narrative, and presenting the storyline in a visually engaging way, would be the most direct and powerful way to educate, inspire, and involve the general public with AUBG.

An alum, and supporter of the AUBGenesis will match up to $5,000 in support of this great project! As all individual donations will be matched by our friends from ABF, that means that you will quadruple your donation!!"
"AUBG is a unique institution that brings together bright academic minds from across the globe and talented students from the Balkans and the former Soviet Bloc to promote top-class higher education and advance Western democratic values. The idea to establish a US academic institution in this war-torn region crippled by the devastating effects of Communism dates back to the late 1980s. Back then, a group of visionaries, among whom financier and philanthropist George Soros, representatives of the US Embassy in Bulgaria, USAID officials, and many more, went against all odds to make what appeared as an impossible dream come true."
AUBGenesis Documentary Project
Join us in supporting the AUBGenesis Documentary Project and showcasing to the world the remarkable history of the American University in Bulgaria!
"On the eve of its 30th anniversary, AUBG has graduated over 5,000 students, who share a commitment to the critical elements of its mission to promote democratic values and have taken critical leadership positions in government, civil service, and non-governmental structures. They are also some of the most successful and accomplished executives and entrepreneurs in the region, bringing the benefits of their education to society at large and their individual lives."
Several shorter movies narrating the amazing stories of the people who played an active part in the University’s establishment.
Support the Project and Make History at AUBG!
"The AUBGenesis Documentary Project is a multimedia initiative in commemoration of AUBG’s 30th anniversary. It aims to record, preserve and present to the general public the history of AUBG’s inception, and relate it to today’s impact of the institution on the region and worldwide. The produced content would appeal not only to the broad public but also to journalists and historians as a one-stop source of research on the volatile and impactful period and its key figures."
The project consists of two main components:
"This historic endeavor, however, requires considerable investment. Therefore, we turn to you with an appeal to support us in funding the project and transmitting the highest values and ideas of AUBG to as many people as possible. Let us all join forces in spreading the mission of AUBG across the world!"

Scholarships
"Support for students directly contributes to fulfilling the promise of AUBG.  With many students coming from the least affluent environments, and accepting the responsibility of tuition in order to receive a quality education at AUBG, scholarships provide a critical component in opportunity for deserving students.  Many options exist for student support at all levels.  This is a gift that renders dividends well into the future."
"The American University in Bulgaria is committed to financially supporting its students and as a result, we cover 60 percent of their tuition fees, which leaves us with a $5,000 scholarship gap per student per year. In order for AUBG to be able to live up to its promise, we need external funding and support."
"Your contribution aids AUBG’s commitment to provide world-class education to some of the brightest students from more than 40 countries regardless of their social background. Your gift plays a vital role in encouraging these young minds in their pursuit of excellence, personal and professional success, and service to the region and the world."
"Your contribution has a lasting impact on our students in all stages of their life. You can support deserving students as they enter the doors of the university and make their first steps towards the future. You can give to continuing students as they learn, grow and plan their graduate studies and career path. You can support students with outstanding leadership potential and students with strong academic achievements; you can make a difference in the lives of your fellow citizens and students in great financial need."

ABF Student Center Main Atrium
AUBG provides a representative sample of named gift opportunities and welcomes the development of additional naming opportunities commensurate with donors’ specific interests
"Campus benches can become a part of a person’s special memories: a marriage proposal, a place to announce good news, birthday celebrations and more. You can add to the joy and excitement of campus life - or remember your own special moment by adopting a bench. Your bench adoption supports the upkeep and maintenance of the particular bench you have chosen and is designated by a small plaque on which you can add your personalized message or inscription. Contributions are tax-deductible and matching gifts are accepted."
"Named opportunities advance the American University in Bulgaria strategic priorities. They help us strengthen academic programs, expand facilities and attract outstanding faculty and students."
Naming Opportunities
"Show your support for AUBG and become a special part of the university’s art or business community. By joining our Adopt-A-Seat campaign, you will be able to commemorate family members, friends, favorite teachers, special occasions, etc. by naming a chosen seat at the Dr. Carl Djerassi Theater Hall or the Andrey Delchev Auditorium.

"The café is situated next to the main atrium in the ABF Student Center and brought to the side with an impressive open air porch with wooden decking. A focal point of student social life, it is a place with vivid atmosphere, bright spirit and excellent visitor turnover. The café enjoys a lot of interest from both the AUBG and Blagoevgrad communities."
"The Career Center provides students and alumni with services and resources to empower them as they make critical life decisions and pursue career success. Naming the place where the journey of life after AUBG begins is a unique opportunity, which is very appropriate for both individuals and companies."
"The central atrium is the wide open space between the ground and first floor of the ABF Center. It is positioned between two elevators on one side and the open main staircase on the other. Located at the heart of the ABF building, this is an area of high activity and continual dynamics which serves as an infrastructural bridge which leads to some of the most important and visited places on campus."

The Name-A-Brick Campaign was established more than 10 years ago as a means of honoring AUBG supporters in an enduring manner. An engraved brick is a perfect way to honor dear moments and pay respect to loved ones while contributing to the future of AUBG. More than 130 of our benefactors have chosen to become part of the “Wall of Honor” in our Skaptopara Campus and leave a lasting legacy. With a contribution of $150 – as either a one-time gift or in periodic payments ($12.50 per month for 12 months) – a brick with a personalized inscription will be placed in the AUBG Café.
We develop facilities that ensure that the AUBG physical plant serves the needs of world-class university education while maintaining one of the most remarkable campuses in the region. Naming opportunities allow certain names to grace places that are truly representative of our community. They become part of daily campus life for students and faculty and carry lifelong memories and meaning for generations ahead.

It is available to Bulgarian first-year students at AUBG with a minimum high school GPA of 3.50 on a scale of 4.00 and demonstrated significant social impact in their communities. In addition to the standard application requirements for enrolment in AUBG, applicants for the Bulgarian Social Impact scholarship are also required to submit an essay, video or presentation telling the story of their social impact project, as well as at least one additional reference letter by someone who can verify the truthfulness of the project story by March 7. Projects will be evaluated from the perspective of the sustainability and scaling potential of the positive social change which they have caused, as well as from the perspective of the number of people who have been benefiting from this positive change. Students will present their projects before representatives of AUBG and the Bulgarian business. Scholarship recipients will be required to maintain a minimum CGPA of 3.50 on a scale of 4 during their entire course of study at AUBG to retain the scholarship and will be encouraged to demonstrate continued social engagement via extracurricular activities."
The candidates for this prestigious scholarship will present their social projects (either ongoing or already implemented) to businesses – the companies that actively support their future talents!

The American Schools and Hospitals Abroad (ASHA) has been supporting AUBG since 1998 with an amount of more than $11M. ASHA is one of the first and most important partners of the American University in Bulgaria.
"The generous support of the agency is fundamentally valuable and important to the AUBG community, as it not only provides students with an opportunity to participate in sports and to have a modern art venue equipped with everything necessary for a professional theater production, but also gives them an opportunity to live in a comfortable and safe environment and acts as a tool for bonding and overcoming social, cultural, and national differences. ASHA’s kind support to the construction of the new library building was an important milestone in the modernization of Panitza Library. It was an essential step to enhancing the Library’s role as a welcoming, supportive, and vibrant learning environment. The last grant awarded in April 2017 for AUBG i-Hub aims to provide students with an introduction to technological advances that are enabling rapid innovation and driving change in business, computer science, mathematics, information and sciences, and media and journalism."

The TGE network enables donors, both corporate and individual, residents of one of the 19 participating countries, to financially support the American University in Bulgaria, while benefiting directly from the tax advantages provided for in the legislation of their country of residence. TGE carries out all administrative tasks related to the tax-deductibility of gifts. Depending on the country’s tax laws, TGE partners will fill in all relevant tax forms and deliver, whenever applicable, fiscal receipts testifying to the contribution made."
UK Taxpayers
What is TGE
"When a UK taxpayer makes a gift to AUBG through TGE’s local partner, CAF, the University can take advantage of the UK government scheme GIFT AID and reclaim the tax that the donor has already paid on donations through UK income tax or capital gains tax. The benefactor must note that CAF will share relevant and necessary data with HM Revenue and Customs to enable AUBG to reclaim the Gift Aid on their donation. 

To be able to make this donation tax effectively using the Transnational Giving Europe (TGE) service via CAF, the donor has to sign a Gift Aid Declaration and International Gift Request Form and return everything to CAF along with the check-in sterling drawn on a major UK clearing bank.
Share giving is the most generous tax relief available to benefactors, combining relief on income and capital gains tax. The tax relief can be claimed for the year in which the gift is made. Donors wishing to give stocks or shares to AUBG can do so via:

"At the event, we shared best practices and lessons learned in countering disinformation and information influence activities. Representatives from the media, civil society sector, academia, the public and private sectors convened for an open conversation with practitioners and disinformation experts from Europe and the US. We discussed how the Baltics became leaders in countering disinformation and how the Balkans gained insights into the complexities of malign influence. We also emphasized the need to view disinformation as more than just a tactic but as a strategic information influence operation."

Dis Disinformation Workshop
"During this event, attendees had the chance to listen to a panel of students, faculty, and civil society representatives in Bulgaria who explained the importance of participating in the voting process and the significance of the vote of the first time voters. There was a demonstration on how to use the voting machines for those who were interested."

Lessons in Leadership
Prof. Jean Crombois Piece Featured on Democracy & Society Publication
Rule of Law and the Struggle against Corruption in the Western Balkans
"The Center for Information, Democracy, and Citizenship (CIDC) at AUBG, in collaboration with the Atlantic Council of Montenegro's Digital Forensic Center (DFC), organized a workshop titled ""Investigating Disinformation and Foreign-Sponsored Propaganda: A Case Study of Montenegro."" The workshop aimed to discuss various aspects of disinformation and foreign information influence activities that were potentially harmful to society, with a particular focus on the influence of actors like Russia and China on public discourse in Montenegro. The event also provided students with insights into the DFC's practices in utilizing open-source intelligence tools to track, expose, and counter online disinformation, especially on social media platforms. A special guest at the event was Milan Jovanovi?, a Senior researcher at the DFC."
"The Center for Information, Democracy, and Citizenship, in collaboration with the Political Science Club and the Department of Politics and European Studies, invited the audience to a public lecture by AUBG alumnus and Director of the MA in Democracy and Governance at Georgetown University, Dr. Elton Skendaj. During the lecture, Dr. Skendaj spoke about the rule of law and corruption, which were identified as major threats to democracies in the Western Balkans."
"The CIDC-designed courses focus on developing critical thinking and analysis skills, which are not commonly taught in grade schools across the region. The courses provide students with digital, critical thinking, information literacy, and practical communication skills."
"The event focused on sharing the insights and wisdom gained from the respective of four women leaders, offering valuable knowledge and advice to AUBG students, alumni, and friends. The organizers, CIDC at AUBG and the Development Office, selected the venue of AUBG's Executive MBA program, a source of inspiration for leaders over the last two decades. With support from the AUBG Alumni Association and a generous donation from former AUBG President and aspiring female leader Julia Watkins, the event gathered alumni from various graduating classes. They engaged in networking discussions to explore the concept of equity and its attainability."
"The goal here is to empower young people to navigate the current civic landscape, take initiative, understand their rights and responsibilities, and drive change. Recognizing the urgent need to equip students with the essential skills to do that successfully, CIDC has leveraged AUBG’s academic prowess to deliver unique teaching modules."
"The specter of political polarization is haunting both old and new democracies, causing divisions among the public and a reduction in shared common ground. What accounts for this polarization, and how does it affect democratic processes and citizen engagement? Furthermore, what steps can individuals and societies take to mitigate polarization and bridge significant divides?"
"The workshop was initiated by the American University in Bulgaria's newly founded Center for Information, Democracy, and Citizenship, in partnership with Fulbright Bulgaria and the America for Bulgaria Foundation."
"This course aims to equip students with facilitation skills that enhance group communication, focusing on addressing the phenomenon known as ""toxic polarization"" by political scientists. Throughout the course, we will explore interpersonal tools for countering polarization, including dialogue circles, nonviolent communication techniques, and methods inspired by the theatre of the oppressed."

Understanding humanity through studying what’s gone before
"Where better to gain unique insight into how the world evolved, by studying alongside fellow students from over 40 countries. Disciplines like history, philosophy and anthropology are crucial in organizing and assessing evidence, interpreting complex events and issues and evaluating and solving problems. Students in this department learn to process information and express their ideas with elegance and rigor. This is a critical skill in all fields of decision-making and research such as academia, government, law, journalism and even marketing.


By understanding the past, embracing cultural differences and delving into sources of conflict, in other words, by studying “the other”, you will not only experience the diversity of the world, but also learn to relativize and reconsider your own identity. Thus, you will develop a better understanding of who and what you actually are."

About
"Agile. Fluid. Always-on. Cross-platform. Transmedia. Mulitmedia. Social Media. There has been a revolution in journalism and communication over the past decade, and the only certainty in this fast-paced world is that things will continue to change. That’s why our primary focus is to challenge our students to think on their feet. To hone their craft. To practice, write and rewrite, design and deliver messages that speak to their intended audiences and reach them via the most suitable platform.


JMC students learn how to relate to other people, how to ask questions, and tell stories. They also learn how to understand and apply ethical principles in design, photography, videography and digital editing. Expect to contribute to democracy via the art of persuasion and representation, and to practice your skills in real-life settings. At AUBG we have a digital news site run by students, AUBG Daily. We also have Radio AURA, a student-run radio station and opportunities to create podcasts, videos, short films, and documentaries."

"If you have an inquisitive mind and like to find out how things work or to solve puzzles, then you may have “the right stuff” to become a mathematician. The study of mathematics will make you a smarter, more logical person, it will add unexpected beauty and the joy of discovery to your life, and it will open the door to further study of advanced subjects.


Mathematics is the language used to describe the very fabric of life, the laws of Nature, and is a powerful tool to help you understand economics, probability, statistics and business. It helps you make better decisions too and understand risk."

"Join the Department of Modern Languages and Arts (MLA). Our full-time and adjunct faculty with degrees from prestigious universities and international experience will help you develop your interests and skills and encourage you to explore new perspectives.

Both of our minor programs, Modern Languages and Cultures and Fine Arts showcase different linguistic and artistic traditions around the world. To benefit from the different programs, students conduct research, deliver presentations, and develop academic projects. We invite all AUBG students to take advantage of the breadth of experiences we also offer through our general elective and general education courses (Textual Analysis, Social and Cultural Analysis, and Aesthetic Expression modes of inquiry)!

If you wish to engage in the aesthetic field, the Fine Arts courses offer you the opportunity to expand your horizons and experience the works of the world’s greatest artists such as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Louis Armstrong, Michelangelo, or Rembrandt. Our music courses focus on classical music, jazz, pop, Bulgarian folk music, and contemporary music, allowing a comparison between different music styles. The drawing courses involve extensive practical work and culminate in a public exhibition of student work. You can take part in art exhibitions, piano, harp, and voice concerts. Apart from that, you have the chance to join the AUBG’s award-winning choir, the female folklore ensemble Svetlina, or the Bulgarian Folk Dance Club Samodiva.

Are you passionate about modern languages? Learn Bulgarian, Chinese, French, German, or Spanish. Expand your linguistic skills while discovering new cultures. Choose from courses exploring the works of Goethe, Cervantes, Hugo, Botev, and Confucius. Apart from the minor, the general education modules and electives, you can also co-operate with your professors to organize independent studies that suit your interests. How about a class in German Literature and Film, French for International Relations and Diplomacy, Business Spanish or Bulgarian through Acting?

The MLA faculty also welcome you to participate in workshops, exhibitions, competitions, guest lectures, concerts, and conferences. Let the annual Language and Culture Week, together with the Spring Artfest and the International Festival Meeting of Student Choirs inspire you. Enjoy movie nights in any of the offered languages and take part in field trips. Take advantage of the MLL classes and prepare for your future academic and professional endeavors such as Erasmus exchanges, summer schools, Master’s or PhD programs."

Very Short Introduction Institutional Trial
"Your gift to the library of the American University in Bulgaria directly benefits AUBG students and faculty by helping the library acquire, organize and make accessible the large amount of information resources, in electronic or print form, that are available today.
We accept either solicited or unsolicited library materials, as well as monetary contributions. Our goal in accepting gifts is to acquire only materials which are highly relevant to the AUBG needs so we ask donors to provide a list of the suggested materials for donation to the Library Director. It is then up to the discretion of the Library Director and Collection Development Group to evaluate its importance to the AUBG curricula and collection currency."

Circulation Policy
"Circulation/reserve services
Circulation/reserve staff is responsible for the procedures concerning patrons’ access:
Check-in and check-out of library materials. Maintenance of the Panitza library patron database
Maintenance of the collections’ shelf order, keeping track of missing books, placing requests of overdue books and book re-shelving
Helping with reference questions and usage of the catalogue in the absence of the Reference staff
Helping the readers with all technical devices such as CD/DVD players, videos etc. Informing the library users about the library working hours and all changes in it



Library System
The Library’s operations are fully automated using VIRTUA ILS. The VIRTUA integrated library system maintains:
Patrons records, accounts and activities
Check-in, check-out and renew operations
Transactions – requests, audit trails, transaction logs
Reserves maintenance


Eligible patrons
Panitza Library is open to all AUBG students, faculty, alumni, and staff that hold a current and validated ID card. Outside visitors to AUBG are normally permitted to use the Library facilities and resources without checking out materials. Restrictions could be applied during exam periods in December and May. Service is provided at no charge.


Circulation rules
All registered students, staff, alumni, and faculty may borrow materials from the library on their accounts. Library materials may be checked out ONLY with the ID card. You are responsible for items checked out with your library card.


Students and Staff
Students and staff members may take out up to 20 items at a time for a period of three weeks. The specified due date note is provided.
Renewal is possible if the book is not reserved by another reader and a recall is not placed. The first renewal requires only the ID card; any other renewal requires that the material is brought to the library. Library materials on Loan to other readers can be reserved by a student/staff member. An e-mail is automatically sent by the system when the material is returned. The reservation will be valid for three days after the day of the return.
All materials checked out on a student’s/staff member’s account should be returned to the Circulation desk to be checked off the account and then reshelved. All books used within the library must be placed at the Books to be shelved – not left on the reading desks. Students and non-library staff are not allowed to enter the Circulation desk area. Violators of the circulation rules may include severe restrictions for library usage, fines or report to the University administration.


Faculty members
Faculty members may take out up to 30 items at a time for 90 days period. Renewal is possible, if the book is not reserved by another reader and there is not a recall. For first renewal the ID card is enough, for the next renewals the user should bring the material itself.
Library materials on Loan to other readers can be reserved by a Faculty member by providing the accession number of the material. An e-mail is automatically sent by the system when the material is returned. The reservation will be valid for a week after the day of the return.
All materials checked out on the faculty member’s account should be returned to the Circulation Desk to be checked off the account and then reshelved.


Alumni
Alumni may take out up to 3 items at a time for 30 days period. Renewal is possible if the book is not reserved by another reader and there is not a recall.


Renewal
Patrons can renew their materials at the Circulation desk of the library or by visiting My Account on the library page.


Requests
If an item needed by the reader is on loan, the librarian can make a request. If a book on a loan is overdue and is needed by another reader, the librarian sends a recall e-mail letter. A patron may place holds on library items through the My Account. The patron will need to log in in his/her account using a library barcode (as printed on the student/faculty/staff ID) and password. When the patron has searched and found the item in the catalog she/he needs to click on the ""Request” button.


Overdue/Lost library materials
When library materials are overdue the reader will be notified by email, sent automatically by the library system. If any part of the library material is missing upon return, (e.g. missing cassette, missing booklets, disks, etc.) user can replace the missing part(s), the user will be charged a replacement fee only. If the patron is not possible to replace the missing part(s), user will be charged for the entire cost. In case of lost library materials, the librarian gives the patron a ‘lost book form’ to fill in and sign. After the reader brings to the librarian a receipt from the Business office for the payment of the book and shipping costs, the librarian deletes the book from the account of the reader and then gives it to the acquisition librarian to be further processed.


Fees
Fines for overdue library materials are as follows:
Reserves and other limited check-out materials – $1.00 per day
Regular check-outs - $0.10 per day
Faculty is not charged overdue fines.
If material is lost, its full cost plus $10.00 shipping and processing fees will be charged towards the reader’s financial account. Repairable damage of a book will result in $5.00 fee. If material is non-repairable damaged, the reader will be charged the cost plus $10.00.


Missing book on the shelf
If a book is with the status ‘Available’ on the catalog record but is missing on the shelf, the reader fills in a search form. The librarian makes three book searches within a month. If the book cannot be found during that period the Circulation/Reserve librarians submit the lost book form to the Acquisitions librarian for further processing.

Outside AUBG visitors
Outside AUBG visitors fill in a form before using library materials. The Circulation librarians help them to find the needed material.


Reserve materials
Materials on Reserve can be used in the library for 2-hours. Reserve materials cannot be taken out of the library. Students may check out up to three reserve materials at one time. Students should ask for reserve material by giving the author and the title of the material, the course and the name of the faculty member. Dismembering, damaging, and highlighting reserve material is not allowed. Reserve materials must be returned at the Reserve Desk. Electronic reserves can be accessed through the link on the reserve bibliographic record.


Online reserve materials
Access to the online materials is available through the Library Catalog.  Access is restricted via the university net. The policy also supports direct linking to the collection of licensed journals articles and e-books, rather than digitizing from print. Note that the licenses do not permit storing copies of the licensed material on another server for the purposes of printing or online access.


Print reserve materials
Book chapters
The Copyright Act permits the copying of a reasonable amount, which generally means a maximum of one chapter. This is the maximum from any book that may be copied in print for any course for the period that the course is being offered.


Journal articles
The Copyright Act permits the copying of one article per journal issue, or two or more if they are from a special issue of a journal. No greater quantity from a single issue may be copied for students for the duration of the course.


Freedom of access
Panitza Library does not restrict access to any materials. Library privileges may be canceled if abused.


Confidential information
Library registration files and circulation records are confidential under Bulgarian law in order to protect the individual's right to privacy. Unpaid Library debts are financial records which are not confidential and may be disclosed.

Gifts
"In addition to the generally applicable American University in Bulgaria policies and regulations regarding the use of University facilities and property, the following specific library use and conduct policies apply:
Library patrons are expected to respect the rights of other patrons to use library resources and facilities in a quiet, clean, and peaceful atmosphere
Library patrons are expected to respect and care for all library materials, equipment, and property and may not remove such items from the library without proper checkout or authorization
Library patrons must not engage in disruptive activity or other behavior that interferes with the normal use and operation of the library. Such behavior includes but is not limited to: verbal abuse, intimidation, or harassment
Library patrons must not maliciously access, alter, damage, or destroy any library computer or database
Library patrons must respect a staff member's request to relinquish a computer, other equipment or library material for use by another patron
Children under the age of 16 must be supervised by a parent, tutor, youth program coordinator, or other responsible adult while in the library
Library patrons are responsible for their personal property at all times, and should never leave it unattended. The Library is not responsible for any loss or damage to personal property
In order to provide an optimum environment for using the library, users should conduct cell phone conversations away from study and research areas and turn off ringers while in the library. Food and drinks are prohibited in the library building with the exception of bottles of water


All library patrons are expected to comply with these policies of library use. Failure to comply with these policies may be grounds for removal from the Panitza Library on a temporary or permanent basis."
Interlibrary Loan Policy
Library Computer Use Policy
Library Resources
Library Social Media Policy
"Panitza Library encourages and appreciates donations of library materials as well as monetary contributions, provided the donated resources are highly relevant to the AUBG needs. The Library does not usually accept or retain the following types of materials:
Material whose subject matter does not fall within the current collection objectives
Outdated material on subjects well represented in the library’s collection (unless historically significant)
Odd copies of periodicals (unless needed to complete holding in the collection)
Duplicate copies of materials that the Library owns (unless there is a great demand for a particular title, or if they can be used to replace worn copies)
Gifts in other languages than English and Bulgarian are accepted if they support the university’s modern language studies program
Materials in poor physical condition
Textbooks (except these in high demand)


Gifts of library materials should be directed to the Collection Development Librarian who evaluates them by consulting the Collection Development Group and faculty members. Materials are evaluated for retention on the same basis as purchased items. The Library is not obliged to retain gifts that fail to meet its selection criteria. In case of large donations the Collection Development Group makes a decision after careful discussion and explains the reason of refusal/acceptance to the donor. For large donations the Library requires a list of titles to be provided and only the titles evaluated for inclusion will be shipped to the University.
The Library does not appraise gift items, and any appraisal information used by the donor for tax purposes is the responsibility of the donor. An acknowledging letter, which includes a description of the item but not its value, is sent to the donor. A gift plate may be affixed to the donated material showing the donor’s name or the person in whose honor or memory the gift was made. When a monetary donation is given, the Library adheres to reasonable wishes of the donor, such as the purchase of particular titles or works within a given subject field. Gifts not added to the collection are offered to other libraries or included in the annual “Friends of the Library” campaign whose goal is to collect contributions for new acquisitions."
"Purpose of the Interlibrary Loan (ILL) service
Panitza Library supports Patrons’ research needs by offering a wide range of additional resources via interlibrary loan service. The Library has established contacts not only with local Bulgarian libraries, but also with many international ones through WorldCat, AMICALCat, British Library Document Supply Center and SUBITO Document Delivery Service. ILL acquires books, conference papers, copies of journal articles, not owned by Panitza Library.

Eligible users
Interlibrary Loan service is available to all current AUBG faculty, students and staff that hold a valid ID card. This service is NOT available to Alumni, guest or community borrowers.

Limitations and cost
The service is free of charge only for limited users – faculty and senior students, with certain restrictions on the number of the free ILL borrowings:
Faculty members: up to 5 materials per academic year
Senior students: up to 3 materials per academic year. Senior students should provide an approval from their senior thesis advisor, stating that the requested material is highly needed for the student’s research work
The requester themselves should pay for orders exceeding this limit. All other users of the service are required to pay part of the cost of each request. The fees are as follows:
For article - $ 3.00
For book or other paper format document - $15.00.
Although the paid service is unlimited, ILL is designed to be used for serious research projects. The library reserves the right to refuse any ILL request if it is deemed to fall beyond the reasons the service was designed for.

Make an order
by email - ill@aubg.edu; nbell@aubg.edu
by fulfilling an electronic form (paper copy can be obtain from the library Circulation Desk)
personal request – please contact the Serials and ILL Librarian, Panitza Library, Office 208, ext. 340
Fill out the form completely
Give an accurate bibliographic citation and the source of each reference.
Provide your ID card number, name, and email address
Fill out a separate form for each item he/she wants
Forms that are incomplete, or have inaccurate citations delay the process
Turn in the completed form(s) at the Circulation desk, the ILL office or via email

Restrictions for ILL
The following materials cannot be requested through ILL:
entire issues/volumes of a periodical
most genealogical material
some current year materials
audiovisual material
reference and archival documents
pictures
rare, valuable and fragile materials

Delivery time
Most requests are filled within 3 -10 days. However, delays are common and it may take up to 28 days, if the requested item is out of the ordinary, in great demand or if the details that the Patron supply are incomplete or inaccurate. Sometimes the first owning library may choose not to loan the material and in such cases a second or third library must be contacted. Nevertheless, there is no guarantee that a request can be filled.
The ILL Librarian will inform the Patron via email of the status of the request – if it is available for order, specific conditions of the lending library (for example, in-library use only, shorter due date), and approximately how long it will take to be delivered. The Patron may contact the ILL librarian to check the progress of the requests and should inform the ILL librarian as soon as possible if he/she no longer requires an item. If the request is already fulfilled, the student has to pay the full fee.

Reinitiating request
The Patron may ask that an unfilled request be reinitiated. However, the ILL librarian must first determine if there is sufficient reason to expect a second request to be filled. The Patron may be asked to provide additional information or to agree to some reset condition established by the lending library (for example, in-library use only, shorter term for use).

Secure electronic delivery (SED)
SED is a service from the Subito Document Delivery Service or The British Library Documents Supply Center, which supplies some ILL electronic copies. Instead of the lender printing a copy of an article and posting it, they put a copy on their web server for users to read or print out for limited time. The Patron will get an email to tell him/her how to access the material, as well as instructions about necessary software requirements.

Loan periods and due dates
After receiving the material, the ILL librarian will inform the Patron that the requested document is ready to be checked-out and that the fee, specified in the ILL policy, will be deducted from his/hers account. The loan period for books is determined by the lending library. Normally it is 21 days. The due date is indicated on the yellow card, given to the Patron on check out. The card has to be kept and returned together with the book. All materials should be returned by the due date to the Circulation desk of the library where they were picked up. Borrowers, who disregard due dates, jeopardize their Interlibrary Loan borrowing privileges. Patrons will be charged one dollar ($1.00) per day for each day that an Interlibrary Loan book is overdue. All items should be returned to the Panitza Library staff at the Circulation desk and NOT directly to the lending library!

Loan recalls
The lending library retains the right to request the immediate return of any material it has loaned to Panitza Library at any time before the original due date given. In these rare instances, the ILL librarian will contact the Patron and inform him/her of the new due date. The Patron will owe an overdue fine for any materials returned after this newly established due date.

Renewal request
A Patron may ask that the loan period of a borrowed item be extended. Any request for renewals must be made before the due date. The lending library determines the length of time, if the loan period may be extended at all. Many items borrowed through ILL are clearly marked ""NO RENEWAL"". No attempt will be made to extend the loan period of these items.

Lost/damaged materials
The lending library will determine the replacement cost of any lost or damaged material. All charges will be paid by the Patron, responsible for the lost/damaged materials."
"Purpose
The purpose of the social media policy is to provide effective guidelines as well as to implement new approaches of managing community-oriented library content: library services, resources, events, news, initiatives, etc. 
The library social media presence will comply with Panitza Library’s mission to use a combination of traditional and new technology-driven sources in a creative way to support and inspire all students on their academic journey and provide excellent customer service.

Social Media Accounts Administration
“Social media” refers to any third party hosted online platform, including but not limited to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, etc.
All social media accounts should be created with the permission of the library director. The library director may assign an employee /employees to manage social media accounts or to be added as account administrator.

"Purpose
To explain the tasks and duties of the Reference Department
To describe the core skills and competencies of the reference staff
To state the professional, ethical and behavioral standards of reference service
To outline parameters of reference service, thus insuring consistency and clarity

Goal of Reference Services
The general service goal of the Department is to meet the information / research needs of library users (faculty, students, alumni, staff and other patrons) in an accurate, efficient, and pleasant manner. An additional goal is to provide instruction so that patrons may become more independent in their use of library resources.


Specific Objectives of Reference Services
It is the policy of Panitza Library to consider each individual information query to be of equal merit regardless of the age, gender, ethnicity, disability, sexual preference or English language proficiency of the library patron. The Library's intention is to accord equal attention and effort to each inquiry, although the time spent by staff on a question may vary in response to the perceived needs of the patron, the information resources (both staff and collections) available and the method of receipt of the inquiry. There are some limits to service for non-university patrons (see appropriate section below).
To maintain an up-to-date, relevant and readily accessible working collection of reference materials, (electronic and paper) relating primarily to the University's programs. The reference collection includes general and research-oriented dictionaries, encyclopedias, biographies, bibliographies, indexes, directories, almanacs, handbooks, and statistical sources.
To give appropriate reference assistance to the Library's clientele in real-time (i.e., when it is needed, regardless of where the patron is). In helping patrons, the reference staff determines the need of the patron; the exact information requested and tries to find sources appropriate to the level of knowledge and interest of the patron. This service is provided regardless of whether the patron has come to the library, telephoned, e-mailed or engaged in an online chat session.
To provide instruction in how to use the Library by the most effective means and with suitable cooperation with other Library units.
To create pathfinders and other printed guides to the library's resources.
To actively publicize the scope, nature, and availability of the information services we offer.
To facilitate access to library materials which are not available in the Library.
To teach/model information literacy skills for lifelong learning.
To create an environment for and a tradition of good service within the Department and to promote the effective utilization of the staff and materials at our disposal.
To cooperate with other Library units by providing them with information about user needs derived from ongoing contact with our users.

Types of reference questions
Directional - Answer patrons' questions about the library, its collections and services and help patrons locate items in the library's collection.
Ready Reference - Answer factual reference questions which can be answered relatively briefly by using reference sources
Specific search questions
Library policy and procedures questions
Instructional
Assist patrons in using the library's databases and other online sources.
Assist patrons in using Internet resources.
Assist patrons in using library’s OPAC.
Instruct patrons in using the library's computers and other equipment.


Research reference
Identifying potential resources for conducting research or suggesting possible search strategies.
Assist patrons in evaluation of resources to best meet information needs.
Referring patrons to other resources, libraries, or institutions when the nature of the question is beyond the scope of the library's resources or mission.
In-depth reference appointments for faculty and senior students engaged in research based endeavors.


Reference Staff Core Competencies and Characteristics
Reference services are provided by qualified librarians with training or experience in this area of librarianship. Reference staff will strive to adhere to the Professional Competencies for Reference and User Services Librarians and to the Guidelines for Behavioral Performance of Reference and Information Service Providers, both of the American Library Association.

Standards of Service
Assisting the immediate library user, whether in person or on the telephone, takes priority over all other tasks. All patrons will receive respectful and courteous attention. Questions will be answered using the best and most authoritative available resource. Every reasonable effort will be made to answer the patron's question to his or her satisfaction, keeping in mind that staffing limits may not always allow a single patron to monopolize a staff member's time. While no strict time limit can be set for a reference transaction, staff may need to limit their assistance to ten or fifteen minutes when they see other patrons waiting for assistance. When reference staff assists patrons with research it shall be done in the physical or online presence. The priority will be serving patrons at the reference desk, then via virtual reference tool and then by email.

Services to users
Panitza library primarily serves the students, facility, and staff of the American University in Bulgaria. Faculty members will be served with priority. Occasionally, reference staff receives questions from outside visitors. Staff will respond to these as time and resources allow. When reference questions are asked while reference librarians are not at work (during the week-end and after 5:00 o’clock at working days) the circulation staff answers directional, policy and procedures and specific reference questions. They should not try to answer instructional and research questions. Instead they should advice patrons to come and meet the reference librarian or fill the printed or on-line request form for reference assistance. The circulation staff has to assist the patron in filling-up the request form.


Reference department does not offer the following services:
Actually doing the patron's research. Typing or otherwise preparing the patron's documents. Proofreading or otherwise correcting the patron's work.
Performing calculations or translations, unless the matter can be handled briefly and is within the staff member's own knowledge.
Providing medical, legal or financial advice or services.
Engaging in psychological or vocational counseling.
Appraising or evaluating used books, manuscripts, paintings, artwork, antiques, or collectibles.
Giving in-depth computer instruction. By this is meant teaching patrons basic computer operations and skills or assisting them in technical problems with their personal computer equipment.
Patrons desiring basic computer training will be referred to AUBG OCC qualified individuals. Reference staff will assist patrons with specific questions about computer applications, if they are within the scope of the staff members’ knowledge, and will provide quick troubleshooting.

Reference assistance hours
Monday - Friday 8:00 - 17:00
Chat with librarian: Monday - Friday 8:00 - 20:00
Basic reference support is available during all open library hours."

About
Courses
"Diaz, Felix"
"Lucci, Diego"
"Our philosophy program introduces students to the human struggle for meaning, examining the history of philosophical, moral, and political thought in an exciting and engaging way. The study of philosophy significantly contributes to the education of self-fulfilled individuals and responsible citizens, exposing them to moral decision-making processes through the study of existential questions, ethical dilemmas and political issues. Thus, our philosophy courses empower students to critically approach any subject of investigation, think in a logical, linear, well-organized way, and formulate sound and convincing arguments. These skills are essential not only in philosophical analysis, but also in other fields and careers, such as business, marketing, communications, politics, IT, and still others.

As regards our psychology program, our goal is to introduce students to the study of psychology in an increasingly complex, global, and interactive world. Studying psychology will increase your understanding of the role of individual and group psychology in what we think, feel, and behave. Understanding how we think, feel and behave, both as individuals and in relation with others will help you to apply psychological concepts to your university studies, and perhaps to better understand yourself and others.

Our program provides a broad-based introduction to psychology that is applicable to a wide variety of careers as with a secondary major or minor program. This creates a solid foundation for those who wish to pursue advanced studies in various areas of specialization within psychology and related disciplines. We start with introductions to the field of psychology, psychology research methods, and social psychology. From there, students can choose to study a variety of subjects that interest them: human development, cognitive psychology and the physiological foundations that make psychological experience possible. We also explore abnormal psychology, the study of personality, and the psychology of social change – because it is not enough to simply understand the world, but to change it.

Our psychology program works in conjunction with courses in the Business and Political Science programs. Psychology faculty can work with students to create a Senior Thesis to compliment a dual major, or an advanced independent study program to explore their own interests.

Through the psychology program we give great importance to strengthening general skills including: the critical analysis of human action and experience in the light of social, cultural and historical conditions; the ability to understand different perspectives on an issue, and to take a reasoned stance in controversies; the application of psychological theory to practical situations and contemporary problems.

Psychological knowledge is crucial to different professional fields: supporting mental health, quality of life and people with disability through individual and group intervention; designing and developing educational programs for children or adults; supporting organizations in the participatory management of work."

It is important to notice that the location and positioning of the video-cameras are such that they do not cover the surrounding public space (owned by Blagoevgrad Municipality); the cameras are aimed to give a general overview of what`s happening in certain places, not to recognize individuals."
The personal information we collect from you is the following:
"The system is also not used as an investigative tool or to obtain evidence in internal investigations or disciplinary procedures unless a security incident is involved. (In exceptional circumstances, the data may be transferred to local investigatory bodies in the framework of a formal disciplinary or criminal investigation). The CCTV cameras are installed at the entrances, placed and focused in a way that only people who want to access the site or the surrounding areas (including parking areas) are captured."
The University Security office will keep student access control information until the end of the current Academic year. After that period any CCTV recorded footage is automatically deleted.
The University Security office will keep your personal data from CCTV cameras for maximum of two calendar months after your visit our premises. After that period any CCTV records are automatically deleted.

This includes people who have a record of such an impairment, even if they do not currently have a disability. It also includes individuals who do not have a disability but are regarded as having a disability.”"

"""The campus is like a small town with people of about 50 nationalities, each doing something small for others and the community as a whole.""
- Lyubomir Yanchev, student"
"As technology continues to make the world of work more connected, there’s never been a better time to make broadening your horizons a top priority. It’s well known that diverse teams perform better, and at AUBG, our Diversity Program will give you the edge."
"AUBG is committed to the most vital principles of freedom and equality. The university has a zero-tolerance policy toward discrimination against students, faculty, and staff on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression."
AUBG stories
"AUBG strives to accommodate, where reasonably practicable, the needs of students, faculty, and staff of all religious backgrounds and/or philosophical beliefs. The university acknowledges the fundamental importance of mutual respect and equality between the religious members of the community and those with no religious affiliation."
"Back in 1991, it all started with one international student from Norway – Kasra Mottahedeh. Nowadays, AUBG is home to some of the brightest students from over 40 countries."
Disability
Diversity
Ethnicity and race
"Our Diversity Program kicks off right in Orientation week with a half-day workshop. After that, our dedicated Diversity Team (made up of a representative cross-section of students, staff, and administrators, all of whom get special training) leads many fun and varied events throughout the year to inspire and encourage you to get involved. Some examples are Diversity Week and the Dance and Taste Fest."
Religion
Sexual orientation and gender
"The University does its best to ensure the accessibility of campus facilities, academic programs, and extracurricular activities to all individuals with disabilities."
"The University values its diverse community comprised of students, faculty, and staff of various racial and ethnic groups. It is of great importance to recognize and promote equality among all constituencies.
Nationalities from six continents - all make up for the diversity on campus. Around 50% of the AUBG student body and faculty is coming from countries different than Bulgaria."
We take diversity seriously at AUBG: our unique position as a global university in one of Europe’s most ancient civilizations gives us a point of view you won’t find elsewhere.

"A certificate can only be issued if the student has contacted the center's medical staff at the moment of the disease and/or visited the center for a physical exam. If the student seeks an excuse after the disease has gone, they might not get one."
"A sum of 10 USD is deductible as a co-payment from the amount of the first claim. The total coverage may not exceed $7,500. This amount has been proven to be adequate for the current market prices and the needs of the students."
"According to the AUBG Health Insurance policies, all full-time international students are automatically enrolled in this plan and the cost of the insurance will be charged to the student’s account immediately after the initial fall or spring enrollment."
"According to the AUBG Policies & Procedures and the American College Health Association guidelines for student health, AUBG provides an appropriate medical insurance plan for our international students. It is contracted with a Bulgarian insurance company and covers the expenses for acute and chronic illnesses, accidents, basic dental services, and repatriation. This medical insurance is valid only in Bulgaria, with a period of coverage for one semester (four months) or a full academic year (nine months)."
"According to the Health Insurance Law, the Bulgarian state budget covers Bulgarian students' health insurance installments."
"According to the insurance policy, the subject of coverage is medical services non-Bulgarian students will need outside the AUBG Health & Well-being Center due to acute and chronic diseases (requiring ongoing monitoring and treatment) and accidents, including:"
"All students can use the services of more than 60 dentist practices in Blagoevgrad. Payment for the services is the student's responsibility and will be covered according to the respective regulations of the Health Insurance Law and the terms of the health insurance contract between the National Health Insurance Fund and the dentist providing the dental service. According to the current agreement, the state health insurance partially covers a dental exam, treatment of non-complicated tooth decay, a tooth filling, and tooth extraction, including local anesthesia."
All these procedures might be completed online and via means of distant communications.
"All visiting students for one semester may use their own health insurance plan if it covers the expenses in Bulgaria at least to the same level the AUBG health insurance plan does. They have to present proof of such insurance during their check-in procedure at the Health & Well-being Center. In this case, the students will be responsible for all claim procedures to comply with their insurance plan."
"At the beginning of their study, all new Bulgarian AUBG students must fill in a declaration stating that they are under 26 years of age and do not have their own income. If they do not meet that criteria, the health insurance installments will be their own responsibility."
"AUBG will make every reasonable effort to be accommodating to students with documented disabilities who need academic and/or housing accommodations. Reasonable accommodations include but are not limited to making facilities accessible, providing adaptive equipment, and providing student assistants to support the student in and/or outside the classroom. AUBG has ultimate discretion to choose among effective accommodations."
Case Management
Case management services offer a holistic assessment of the client’s individual health needs with an emphasis on enhancing overall health and well-being. The role of case management is:
Cash payment procedure
Cash-free procedure
Claim Procedures
Confidentiality
Confidentiality is a cornerstone of counseling sessions. We believe counseling is most effective when a student can be direct and honest with a counselor without fear that personal information will be divulged. Confidentiality is also an ethical and legal requirement.
consultations on a variety of health-related issues;
Counseling is a collaborative process that involves joint problem-solving in a confidential context. Almost all counseling is based on:
Counseling may be helpful if you feel concerned about any of the following:
Counseling Process
"Counseling services are provided free of charge to all students. When appropriate, the staff refers students to other campus offices as well as to other human services agencies in the country."
Coverage
Crisis Intervention
Dental Services
Details
Eligibility
"Equipment for some basic diagnostic and lab tests is available on-site. When necessary, the center issues referrals for laboratory tests, x-ray, consultation with specialists, and/or hospital treatment at other healthcare facilities."
"EU citizens may use the EU health insurance card (HIC) for medical service coverage. However, we recommend that they enroll in our insurance plan since the EU HIC covers only emergencies and requires procedures that are more bureaucratic in order to get help when someone needs it."
EXCEPTIONS:
Group Counseling
Health and Well-being Center
"health education, etc."
Health expense reimbursement documents
Health Insurance for Bulgarian Students
How Do I Know If I Need Counseling?
"If the needs of the student are outside the scope of our center, we will provide referral resources within the institution and the local community as needed. If you are concerned about a friend please make an appointment to speak with a professional or one of the peer educators."
immunizations;
Improving Learning and Performance Group
"In all other non-partner health facilities, students have to pay in cash for the services they receive. After submitting all required medical documents at the Health & Well-being Center or one of the insurance company’s offices, listed below, the insurance company will reimburse their medical expenses."
"In case a student has a long-term health problem that stops them from attending the regular academic activities for a period longer than is allowed by the courses’ syllabi, they could apply for a leave of absence for the respective semester. In this situation, they should contact the Registrars’ Office to start the procedure. The student has to present to the Health & Well-being Center Director a medical summary, signed by a specialist with explanation of the health problem specifics, the necessary treatment and how it affects their ability to study."
"In case the student visits an external physician or medical facility, they have to take a referral letter from them with an explanation of the health problem. After presenting it to the Health & Well-being Center, they will receive the excuse certificate to present to the professor(s)."
"In life-threatening situations, the duty to protect supersedes the right to confidentiality and we may call for additional help, without permission, to protect you or someone else from imminent danger."
"In order to avoid interruption of their health insurance rights to medical services, students have to cover the insurance instalments for the months between their high school graduation and the beginning of their university studies."
In this group the participants will be given tools which help to explore the conditions that affect that affect their own learning process and influence their achievements.
"In this setting the counselor facilitates the therapy process while allowing group participants to discuss and share their feelings and concerns. Since most developmental issues for college students relate in some way to their interpersonal functioning, this exciting process is extremely useful and effective. Group counseling provides an opportunity for students to practice new ways of behaving and relating to others in a relatively safe environment."
Individual Counseling
International Students Support Group
"Keep in mind that by far, not all Bulgarian health facilities can provide services contracted with foreign health insurance companies. We recommend that all AUBG students use the university health insurance plan for easier access to health services in Bulgaria."
lab test referrals;
Leave of absence for medical/health reasons
Managing Strong Feelings
"Many students visit the Counseling Center because they want to learn more about themselves as they integrate into the university community. Some students come because they want to improve their studies or are unsure about their major. Others come because they have difficult decisions to make, or are dealing with an unhappy turn of events in their lives. Perhaps they have a general feeling that they could be getting more out of life, or they want to explore their relationships with people and world around them."
Medical Services
"Medical summaries/reports and/or referral notes from the specialist(s), lab tests, and prescriptions for medicines prescribed from a physician in relation to the disease and all invoices for the prescribed medicines and/or tests paid separately in cash, if any."
Missed class(es)
"Our goal is for all AUBG students, faculty, and staff to be able to access our services and receive acceptance regardless of culture, gender, generation, ethnicity, lifestyle, spirituality, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, national origin, language, or physical and mental disabilities."
"Outside the AUBG Health & Well-being Center, students can use the services of the local health facilities, both state and private."
Patient confidentiality and privacy are guaranteed according to the Health & Well-being Center Policies & Procedures and the laws in effect.
Peer Educators
"Personal counseling allows the student to talk with a caring professional on a one-on-one basis. This therapeutic relationship can assist the student in solving their current problems and conflicts, while exploring their beliefs and values, and taking into consideration developmental issues associated with college life. The ultimate goal is to help the student find a greater sense of balance and satisfaction in their personal life."
Personal Growth Counseling Group
Referrals
routine physical exams and health evaluations;
"Stressful events, emotional upsets, and emergency situations are part of life. A crisis does not necessarily follow a traumatic event, nor does it imply or inevitably lead to an emotional or mental breakdown. Something that is a crisis for one person may not be a crisis for another. Crisis intervention is a short-term helping process. It focuses on the resolution of the immediate problem using available resources."
Stress-Relief Support Group
"Students also come for counseling because they feel something is bothering them but they do not know what it is and they do not know how to talk about it. New and returning students, men and women, culturally diverse students, and students of differing sexual orientation, among others, use the Counseling Center. It would be unusual to have a student who at some time did not experience challenges in adapting to new situations and changes taking place."
Students can use the services in many partner health facilities (that have a contract with the insurance company) where they will not pay in cash.
"Students have the right to miss a class when their health condition prevents them from attending. In order to excuse the absence before the professor(s), they have to present a certificate signed by the Director of the Health & Well-being Center."
Submit all documents that apply to your case to reimburse expenses covered by your health insurance.
"The above-mentioned law requires all Bulgarian citizens to have a general practitioner (GP). When making their first GP selection and enrolling, the patients receive a health insurance book which is their pass to the covered medical services. When someone changes their GP, they have to present it to the new GP for registration of the change. In order to guarantee easier access to medical services, AUBG recommends that Bulgarian students select a GP in Blagoevgrad for the period of their education."
"The approximate premium for the 2020-2021 academic year is $75, or $40 per semester. This amount is subject to change. It will be charged to each student’s account and it will be their own responsibility to pay it."
"The AUBG Health & Well-being Center provides health education brochures and information on different student-oriented topics for free. It also organizes or participates in university activities on health-related issues. The main topics are women's health, smoking cessation, safe sex and STDs, first aid training, drug & alcohol abuse."
"The AUBG Health and Well-being Center assists students, faculty, and staff in getting prompt consultation, evaluation and treatment of medical problems."
"The Counseling Center provides counseling, educational, and developmental services to the university community. The center is committed to increasing awareness and knowledge of differences so that respectful human interactions and effective interconnections can occur."
"The development of a trusting and open relationship between the client and the counselor.
Honest exploration of feelings, needs, and concerns.
Efforts to try new solutions for old problems."
"The development of a trusting and open relationship between the client and the counselor.

"The focus of the group or workshop is chosen by the needs of the college community as determined by Counseling Center professionals, and students showing interest in a particular topic."
The Health & Well-being Center operates under the regulations established by Bulgarian legislation and the standards of the American College Health Association.
The medical services on site are available through a licensed General Practitioner’s (GP) practice and include:
The Peer Educators are AUBG students who are student liaisons between the Counseling Center and the student body. They are involved with marketing and outreach activities for the Counseling Center.
"The services at the Health & Well-being Center are free for AUBG students, with the exception of some consumables."
"There is a licensed General Practitioner’s practice at the AUBG Health & Well-being Center run by Dr. Ventsislav Daskalov (Health & Well-being Center Director). Bulgarian students may choose to sign up with him. In accordance with Bulgarian law, the practice provides a full range of services covered by the NHIF to the students who have registered with his GP practice. All others may be served on-site, but cannot use referrals to laboratories, specialists, and/or hospitals."
This group is designed to help students cope with and reduce feelings of anger. Participants learn how to identify sources of anger and evaluate how it affects their lives and relationships.
"This group is designed to provide members with a supportive environment for personal and interpersonal development and growth. Group members come from diverse backgrounds and are invited to discuss concerns such as self-esteem, interpersonal relationships, self-knowledge, and social skills. We will use creative activities and role plays to enhance self-knowledge, communication, problem-solving, and general coping skills."
"This group will allow international students to share and explore their experiences of being a student abroad. Topics will include: homesickness, interpersonal relationships, language, educational responsibilities and community resources."
This is an open group that will be offered on a weekly basis during peak stress times in the semester. The group includes relaxation techniques and creative activities to reduce the intensity of stress.

We offer a wide variety of counseling and health services available right on campus.

Annually, we take part in different events such as charity bazaars and initiatives organized by the university, the Active Bulgarian Society, or other organizations. We are glad to have a diverse community in our club: students from every nationality are more than welcome to join us and
create unforgettable memories and friendships. We speak in English but since we want each member to feel and experience the Bulgarian spirit, we will encourage our members to practice their Bulgarian language skills while supporting them. Like every other club, we also have different departments: logistics, marketing, and creative. It is not mandatory to have previous experience of folk dancing. We would appreciate people with previous knowledge of such dances, but we are open to meeting even students who have never danced before. We will show them the basic steps and will help them become more experienced dancers. We gather two times every week for two hours and learn new hora, choreographies, and dances. The biggest event of our club is the play that is performed at the end of every school year. The play is based on a traditional Bulgarian tale or a traditional Bulgarian custom. We take the main idea of a tale or a custom and add our own twist. The play consists of a mixture of dances and roles. BFDC “Samodiva” is proud of our unique and magnificent logo, which reveals the spirit of our club. Since 2015, our club has performed various plays."

"A fairly rare educational system in the region, the liberal arts degree gets many people wondering. Is it just for art students? Can it get me a good job upon graduation? Will it provide me with a solid enough understanding of my major?



And while these are all valid questions, there’s no place for worry. The Liberal Arts educational system is quite popular in the United States and is among those valued most by employers globally. AUBG is one of few universities in the Balkans that offer Liberal Arts, and upon graduation, you get a diploma that is accredited in both the U.S. and the EU.



Liberal Arts is not reserved for art students only. At AUBG, for example, we have a variety of majors and minors spanning from Business Administration to Computer Science, and we make sure that you get a solid understanding and in-depth knowledge in the field you choose to study. What differentiates Liberal Arts from other types of degrees, however, is that in addition to that, it gives you the freedom to explore, create, practice your skills and connect to others."
"And here’s something else: you don’t have to study just one thing. At AUBG, you can graduate with up to two majors and two minors. The majority of our students choose to pursue more than one major because it gives them a unique advantage upon graduation. If you’ve studied both Business Administration and Journalism and Mass Communication, for example, you already have critical knowledge in not one, but two fields of study that marketing agencies value a lot. Or, if you choose to study Political Science and International Relations and complement it with minors in Modern Languages and Cultures and Public Policy, you are already ahead of most other students who want to embark on a political career. With 13 majors and 19 minors at AUBG, you can imagine how many combinations you can choose from, and what career opportunities that creates for you."

"Finding a job in the 21st century can be tricky. A profession that was popular for a long time may cease to exist because of advancing technologies and automation. On the other hand, a profession we didn’t even think we need suddenly becomes popular as new challenges and opportunities arise in the world.



A Liberal Arts degree is the best guarantee that you’ll be prepared for the future of work. Why? Because you’ll be equipped not only with solid knowledge in more than one field but also with the critical thinking skills needed to make sense of that knowledge."
Graduate programs
Liberal Arts Explained
"Liberal arts universities often offer generous scholarship and financial aid opportunities, and AUBG is no exception. In addition to large donations from organizations like America for Bulgaria, the university also receives contributions from companies who look forward to recruiting AUBG graduates, as well as scholarship donations from our very own alumni."
"Once you graduate, you will become part of a tight-knit alumni community of successful professionals. The AUBG alumni take the “pay it forward” principle seriously and participate in a variety of initiatives to support current students and younger graduates. Some of those include the Alumni Mentorship Program, the AUBG Job Fair, and the AUBG Accelerator.



Our students make friendships that last a lifetime and often get together after graduating AUBG to collaborate on their projects or startup ideas. No matter where life takes you upon graduation, you will always have someone from AUBG to offer you support, advice, or a networking opportunity."
Strong alumni network
"The General Education (GenEd) courses are also key to the Liberal Arts System. That means that in addition to the classes in your major(s), you will also take courses in a variety of disciplines such as literature, history, science, and arts. Students who are not used to the Liberal Arts model may find that idea odd at first, but you’d be surprised at the intricate connections that exist among all disciplines. Upon graduation, many AUBG alumni say that it was precisely some of their GenEd courses that they loved the most and that played a crucial role in their career development."
The Liberal Arts and Sciences model of education
"The Liberal Arts System is not only different in terms of what you study, but also in terms of how you study. We emphasize small class sizes (23 students on average) so that each professor can pay personal attention to each student, and so that you get to share your opinion, participate in class discussions and work on group projects. That approach favors practical skills over dry theory, critical thinking over memorizing material, and individual strengths over standardized knowledge.



AUBG also offers a truly international experience on campus so that freedom of thought can develop and thrive. Our professors come from prestigious universities on five continents, and you’ll get to learn with students from 45+ nationalities.



Last but not least, there are dozens of student clubs to complement your classroom learning. You can organize international conferences, host radio shows, join our university musicals, compete in sports tournaments, participate in debates, or choose from many other exciting activities on campus."
"Universities across the globe are happy to accept students with a Liberal Arts degree because they know that such students possess curiosity, critical thinking, and persistence: qualities that are all highly valued in the world of academics.



Many AUBG alumni have continued their education with a master’s degree in universities like Harvard, MIT, Cambridge, Oxford, and The London School of Economics. Some have gone straight for PhD degrees in STEM fields in some of the most prestigious schools in the world. And a few have themselves become respected professors in the U.S., Europe, and beyond."
Unmatched career success
Unparalleled classroom experience
"We don’t expect you to have your career path figured out right after high school. If you don’t know what you want to study yet, that’s ok. In fact, that’s great! When you enter AUBG, you have two years to choose your major(s) and meanwhile, you can explore various interests, enroll in different classes and student clubs, talk to classmates and professors and get to see what suits you best. Of course, if you know what you want to study right away, you can focus on that from the very first day you set foot on campus. It’s all about the freedom of choice!"
